## Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is the website for my introductory statistics book. This book serves as a main reference book for my MATH 4720 Statistical Methods and MATH 4740 Biostatistical Methods at Marquette University.[^index-1] Some topics can also be discussed in an introductory data science course. You'll learn basic probability and statistical concepts as well as data analysis techniques such as linear regression using R computing software.[^index-2] The book balances the following aspects of statistics:

[^index-1]: For some historical reason, the two courses are numbered as senior level courses. However, both are introductory courses taken by STEM students.

[^index-2]: The ultimate goal of this project is to make the code multilingual, including other languages such as Python or Julia.


-   mathematical formulation and statistical computation
-   distribution-based and simulation-based inferences
-   methodology and applications
-   classical/frequentist and Bayesian approaches

The course materials are borrowed from several existing statistics books and notes, especially from the following books:

- [OpenIntro Statsitics (OS)](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/) (data focused)
- [Introduction to Modern Statistics (IMS)](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) (simulation-based and computation focused)
- [An Introduction to Statistical Methods & Data Analysis, 7th edition (SMD)](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/GdeoWEcATWi1pXV1DlPe) (distribution-based and mathematics focused)[^index-3]



[^index-3]: This book has been served as the official textbook for MATH 4720 for years. However, I feel that the book is more suitable for senior undergraduate, graduate students.
