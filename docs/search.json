    "text": "2.2 Population and Sample\n Target Population \n\nThe first step in conducting a study is to identify questions to be investigated.\nA clear research question is helpful in identifying\n\nwhat cases should be studied (row)\nwhat variables are important (column)\n\n\nOnce the research question is determined, it is important to identify the target population to be investigated.\nThe target population is the complete collection of data we’d like to make inference about.\n\n GPA Example \n\n\n\n\nResearch Question: What is the average GPA of currently enrolled Marquette undergraduate students?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Target Population: All Marquette undergraduate students that are currently enrolled.\nBecause all Marquette undergrads that are currently enrolled are the complete collection of data we’d like to make inference about, each currently enrolled Marquette undergrad is an object.\nAverage GPA is the variable or population property we would like to make an inference about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nStudents who are not currently enrolled or students that have already graduated are not our interest, so they shouldn’t be a part of target population.\n\n\n\n Heart Disease Example \n\n\n\nDoes a new drug reduce mortality in patients with severe heart disease?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Target Population: All people with severe heart disease. \nMortality is the variable or population property we would like to make an inference about.\n\n\n\n\n Sample Data \n\nIn some cases it’s possible to collect data of all the cases we are interested in.\nHowever, most of the time it is either expensive or too time consuming to collect data for every case in a population.\nWhat if we tried to collect data on the average GPA of all students in Illinois? The U.S.? The world? 😱 😱 😱\n\n\n\n\nThe solution to this problem is sampling.\nA sample is a subset of cases selected from a population.\nWe are not able to collect the average GPA of every member of the population, but we can collect a sample from that population which has fewer objects (Figure 13.1).\nWe can then compute the average GPA of the sample data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Sampling from the population reduces the number of objects from which to collect data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur hope is that the average GPA of the sample is close to the average GPA of the population, which is our main interest.\nFor the sample’s average GPA to be close to population’s average GPA, we want the sample to look like the population such that they share similar attributes including GPA.\n\n\n Good Sample vs. Bad Sample \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this 4720/5720 class a sample of the target population Marquette students?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Majors of students in this 4740/5740 class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this 4720/5720 class a “good” sample of the target population?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sample is convenient to be collected, but as Figure 2.3 shows, it is NOT representative of the population.\nBecause this class is primarily composed of STEM majors, it may not share the attributes necessary with the target population for the two to share a similar average GPA.\nTherefore, we call this a biased sample.\n\nThe average GPA of the class may differ greatly from the average GPA of all MU undergrads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Sampling from a class of mostly STEM students is not representative of the entire population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 2.5, the average GPA differs based on students’ majors.\nBecause this class consists of mostly STEM majors, it is likely that the average GPA of its students is not the same as the average GPA of all MU undergraduates.\n\nFigure 2.4 depicts that sampling needs to be done appropriately to ensure the sample is representative of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: UC Berkeley average GPAs by major\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How do we collect and why do we need a representative sample? \n\nWe always seek to randomly select a sample from a population.\nRandom sampling usually give us a representative sample, as long as the sample size, or the number of objects in the sample, is not too small.\nIt is important to collect samples this way, because many statistical methods are based on the randomness assumption."

    "section": "\n2.3 Data Collection",
    "text": "2.3 Data Collection\n Two Types of Studies to Collect Sample Data \n\nThere are two types of studies that are used to collect data: observational studies and experimental studies.\nAn observational study is a study in which those collecting the data observe and measure characteristics/variables, but do NOT attempt to modify or intervene with the subjects being studied.\n\n Example: Sample from 1️⃣ the heart disease and 2️⃣ heart disease-free populations and record the fat content of the diets for the two groups. \n\n\nIn an experimental study, some treatment(s) is applied and then those collecting data proceed to observe its responses or effects on the individuals (experimental units).\n\n Example: Assign volunteers to one of several diets with different levels of dietary fat (treatments) and compare the treatments with respect to the incidence of heart disease after a period of time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservational or Experimental?\n\n\n\n\nRandomly select 40 males and 40 females to see the difference in blood pressure levels between male and female.\nTest the effects of a new drug by randomly dividing patients into 3 groups (high dosage, low dosage, placebo).\n\n\n\n Limitation of Observational Studies: Confounding Variables \n\nA confounder is a variable NOT included in a study that affects the variables in the study.\nFor example, a person observes past data that shows that increases in ice cream sales are associated with increases in drownings and concludes that eating ice cream causes drownings. 😱😕⁉️\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the confounder that is not in the data but affects ice cream sales and the number of drownings?\n\n\n\n\nTemperature\n\n\n\n\nAs temperature increases, ice cream sales increase and the number of drownings also rises because more people go swimming (Figure 2.6).\n\n Causal Relationships \n\nMaking causal conclusions based on experimental data is often more reasonable than making the same causal conclusions based on observational data.\nObservational studies are generally only sufficient to show associations, not causality.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Temperature acting as a confounder\n\n\n\n\n\n Types of Random Samples \n\nAs previously mentioned, many statistical methods are based on the randomness assumption.\nTherefore, it’s important to understand what a random sample is and how to collect it.\nIn a random sample, each member of a population is equally likely to be selected.\n\n Simple Random Sample \n\nFor a simple random sample (SRS), every possible sample of sample size \\(n\\) has the same chance to be chosen.\n\nExample: If I were to sample 100 students from all 10,000 Marquette students, I would randomly assign each student a number (from 1 to 10,000) and then randomly select 100 numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Simple Random Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Simple random sample from a population of 15 (https://research-methodology.net/sampling-in-primary-data-collection/random-sampling/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Stratified Random Sample \n\nFor stratified sampling, subdivide the population into different subgroups (strata) that share the same characteristics, then draw a simple random sample from each subgroup.\n\nHomogeneous within strata; Non-homogeneous between strata (Figure 2.9)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Stratified Sampling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Divide Marquette students into groups by colleges, then perform a SRS for each group (Figure 2.10).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Stratified sampling of Marquette Students\n\n\n\n\n Cluster Sampling \n\nFor cluster sampling, divide the population into clusters, then randomly select some of those clusters, and then choose all the members from those selected clusters.\n\nHomogeneous between clusters; Non-homogeneous within clusters (Figure 2.11)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Cluster Sampling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Study 4720 students’ drinking habits by dividing the students into 9 groups, and then randomly selecting 3 and interviewing all of the students in each of those clusters (Figure 2.12).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Cluster sampling of Marquette students"

The data can do \\(\\color{red} +\\) and \\(\\color{red} -\\), but can’t reasonably do \\(\\color{red} \\times\\) and \\(\\color{red} \\div\\).\n\n\nTemperature is interval because \\(80^{\\circ}\\)F is 40 degrees higher than \\(40^{\\circ}\\)F \\((80-40=40)\\), but \\(0^{\\circ}\\) does not mean NO heat and \\(80^{\\circ}\\)F is NOT twice as hot as \\(40^{\\circ}\\)F.\n\n\n\nRatio: The data have both meaningful differences and ratios, and there is a natural zero starting point that indicates none of the quantity.

And of course, it is the chance or uncertainty that makes so many games so fun, amusing and even additive, for example, the board game monopoly, and the gambling machines like slots and blackjacks.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Google search result of “what are chances”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Monopoly baord game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Slots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Blackjacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApparently most people want to quantify uncertainty about something happening, or measure the chances of some event happening for better decision making. The question is, how? We need a consistent way of measuring chances and uncertainty so that our society can be operated in order. Thanks to great enthusiasm for gambling, the mathematical study of chances starts quite early, and nowadays, the most formal and rigorous way of studying chances is to use probability. Therefore, we could probably view probability as the language of uncertainty.\nMost of the time, we cannot do statistical inference or prediction using machine learning without probability because we usually assume our data at hand are random realizations from some targeted population that are described by a probability distribution. In other words, we are doing data analysis in the world of uncertainty. For example, we are interested in the mean height of Marquette female students, which is usually assumed to be bell-shaped distributed. By chances, our collected sample of girls may all have heights below 5’4”, which is not representative of the target population, and the sample mean is far from the true population mean height being interested. Examining the chance of getting such biased data set becomes important and helps us quantify the plausibility of the numerical results we obtain from the data.\nAs a result, before jumping into statistical inference or data analysis, we need to have basic understanding of probability definitions, rules, and operations that are frequently used in the data science community.\n\n Why Probability Before Statistics? \nAlthough probability and statistics are closely related and usually taught in one single introductory course, they are two distinct subjects. Since the randomness of sampling from the target population, statistical inference and data analysis usually involve uncertainty quantification, and hence probability is used in the analysis.\nIn a typical statistical analysis, we assume the target population, for example the Marquette students’ height follows some probability distribution, and the collected sample data are the realized data points from the distribution. With this, the population probability distribution is a mechanism that generates data. In probability theory, we examine how this mechanism generates data, and how the observed data will behave given the fact that they are from the probabilistic data generating process. For example, we assume the height follows some probability distribution, and we are curious about the probability that the sample mean is larger than 5’10”, or that the sample mean is between 5’6” and 5’11”.\nIn the probability theory, the process generating the data is assumed known and we are interested in properties of observations. However, in reality, the data generating process, or the target population distribution, is unknown to us, and is what we would like to infer to using the sample data we collect. For example, we want to estimate the unknown mean height of Marquette students using the data of 100 Marquette students sampled at random from the unknown target population distribution. This is what statistical inference is all about. For statistics, we observe the data (sample) and are interested in determining what process generates such data (population). These principles are illustrated below in Figure 6.5.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Relationship between probability and statistical inference\n\n\n\n\nEven though the data generating process is fixed and unchanged every time a data set is collected, the data replicates are all different due to the random sampling from the population probability distribution. Such randomness creates the uncertainty about how we do the inference about the population properties because a different data set represents only a part of, and probably biased, information about the the whole distribution. As a result, when doing inference, we prefer probabilistic statements to deterministic statements."

    "section": "\n6.2 Interpretation of Probability",
    "text": "6.2 Interpretation of Probability\n Relative Frequency \nThere are several ways of interpreting probability. The first interpretation is relative frequency. Formally speaking, the probability that some outcome of a process will be obtained is interpreted as the relative frequency with which that outcome would be obtained if the process were repeated a large number of times independently under similar conditions.\nThink about the following scenario. Your mom gave you a unfair coin, but she does not know the probability of getting heads when one tosses the coin. How do you obtain, or at least approximate the probability? Well, we can use the concept of relative frequency. First, we decide how many times we want to flip the coin. Each time after flipping the coin, we record either heads or tails shows up. Once we are done all the flips, we count the frequency or the total number of times heads shows up among all the flips. To obtain the probability of getting heads, we calculate the relative frequency, the ratio of the frequency of heads to the number of tosses.\nBelow is an example depicting the relative frequency of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails.\n\n\n\n\n      Frequency Relative Frequency\nHeads         4                0.4\nTails         6                0.6\nTotal        10                1.0\n---------------------\n      Frequency Relative Frequency\nHeads       514              0.514\nTails       486              0.486\nTotal      1000              1.000\n---------------------\n\n\n\n\nWhen we flip the coin 10 times, 4 of them end up being heads, and the probability of getting heads is 40%. You may be skeptical of the result, and want to have more replicates. Some day you have lots of spare time, and you decide to flip the coin 1000 times. The relative frequency, or the probability of getting heads, now becomes 51.4%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you see any issues with relative frequency probability?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApparently, we don’t know the true probability if it does exist. And as you learned in the coin-flipping example, we don’t have one unique answer for that if we use relative frequency as the way of interpreting probability. In fact, there are some issues when we treat relative frequency as probability.\n Issues with Relative Frequency \n\n😕 How large of a number is large enough?\n\nThere is no correct answer for how many replicates of the experiment we should have. We may think 10 times is not enough, but how about 1000 times? one million times? How well the relative frequency approximates the true probability depends on the complexity of the experiments. In general, the larger the number of times of repeating the process, the better the approximation of the relative frequency. This is the result of the so-called law of large numbers that is discussed in Chapter 12.\n\n😕 What is the meaning of “under similar conditions”?\n\nIn the definition, the experiment or process needs to be repeated “under similar conditions”. What does that mean? The definition itself is not rigorous enough. Do we need to control the airflow when the experiment is conducted? How about temperature? Can your mom and you take turns to flip the coin? Be honest, there is no answer for that.\n\n😕 Is the relative frequency reliable under identical conditions?\n\nCan we trust the relative frequency when the experiment is conducted under identical conditions? If there is a skilled person who can control whether heads or tails shows up every time he flips a coin, should we believe the relative frequency is a good approximation to the true probability?\n\n👉 We can only obtain an approximation instead of exact value for the probability.\n\nYou may already find out that the relative frequency is only an approximation instead of exact value for the probability. If we want to get the true probability (if it does exist), we need to get the relative frequency whose process is repeated infinitely many of times, which is unrealistic. Such probability stems from the frequentist philosophy that interprets probability as the long-run relative frequency of a repeatable experiment.\n\n😂 How do you compute the probability that Chicago Cubs win the World Series next year?\n\nIn the real world and our daily lives, lots of times we want to compute the probability of something happening where the something cannot be a repeatable process or experiment. For example, it is impossible to compute the probability that Chicago Cubs win the World Series next year because we would never to able to obtain the relative frequency of Chicago Cubs winning the World Series next year.\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://media.giphy.com/media/EKURBxKKkw0uY/giphy.gif\n\n\n\n\n\n Classical Approach \nAnother interpretation of probability follows the classical approach, whose probability is based on the concept of equally likely outcomes. If the outcome of some process must be one of \\(n\\) different outcomes, the probability of each outcome is simply \\(1/n\\). For example, if you toss a fair coin (2 outcomes) 🪙, the probability of getting heads is 1/2. If you roll a well-balanced die (6 outcomes) 🎲, the probability of each outcome being shown is 1/6. If you draw one from a deck of cards (52 outcomes) 🃏, the probability of each card being drawn is 1/52.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you see any issues with classical probability?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wouldn’t make sense to say that the probability that [you name it] wins the World Series next year is 1/30. Even though there are 30 teams in the MLB, each team is not equally likely to win the World Series. Don’t you agree?!\n\n Subjective Approach \nThe last interpretation of probability we discuss here is the subjective approach, whose probability is assigned or estimated using people’s knowledge, beliefs and information about the data generating process. In this case, it is a person’s subjective probability of an outcome, rather than the true probability of that outcome. For example, I think “the probability that the Milwaukee Brewers win the World Series this year is 30%”. My probability that the Milwaukee Brewers win the World Series this year is likely to be different from an ESPN analyst’s probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.nj.com/yankees/2020/02/mlb-rumors-espns-sunday-night-baseball-will-feature-a-lot-of-ex-yankee-alex-rodriguez-and-not-much-else.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Wiki: ESPN Major League Baseball\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, a probability measures the relative plausibility of some event or outcome, and such probability stems from the so-called Bayesian philosophy. With this, we can claim that candidate A has a 0.9 probability of winning because the probability represents our plausibility or belief about the winning chance of the candidate A. A Bayesian statistician would say based on analysis the candidate A is 9 times more likely to win than to lose. For a statistician with the frequentist philosophy, he might say the statement is wrong or there is no such claim. Or he might weirdly say in long-run hypothetical repetitions of the election, candidate A would win roughly 90% of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nProbability operations and rules do NOT depend on the interpretation of probability!"

    "section": "\n7.1 Probability Operations and Rules",
    "text": "7.1 Probability Operations and Rules\n Experiments, Events and Sample Space \nProbability starts with the concept of sets. When we calculate the probability of “something”, that something is represented as a set, which is a collection of some outcomes generated by an process or experiment associated to the something we are interested. To denote a set, we usually use a pair of curly braces { }, and the elements of the set is put inside the braces, each separated by a comma, for example, {red, green, yellow} is a set with three color elements.\nHere we define some terminology that are commonly used in set and probability concepts.\n\nAn experiment is any process in which the possible outcomes can be identified ahead of time.\n\nThe key words is ahead of time. For example, we know what is the result of flipping a coin, which is heads or tails showing up, before we actually do it. Therefore, flipping a coin is an experiment. Similarly, before we roll a six-sided die, we already know the possible outcome of doing that, which is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, so rolling a die is also an experiment.\n\nAn event is a set of possible outcomes of the experiment.\n\nGenerally there are two or more potential outcomes for some experiment. Any collection of those outcomes is called an event. For example, there are 6 possible outcomes for rolling a die, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Then any collection of those 6 numbers is an event. So “An odd number showing up” which corresponds to the collection {1, 3, 5} is an event. “An even number showing up” that is represented by {2, 4, 6} is also an event.\n\nThe sample space \\((\\mathcal{S})\\) of an experiment is the collection of ALL possible outcomes of the experiment.\n\nBased on the definition, the sample space the largest set associated with an experiment because it collects all possible outcomes. In other words, when an experiment is conducted, no matter what outcome shows up, it is always in the sample space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the sample space also an event?\n\n\n\n\nYes, the sample space itself is an event because it is also a set of possible outcomes of the experiment.\n\n\n\nThe table below provides a summary of experiments flipping a coin and rolling a die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\nPossible Outcomes\nSome Events\nSample Space\n\n\n\nFlip a coin 🪙\nHeads, Tails\n{Heads}, {Heads, Tails}, …\n{Heads, Tails}\n\n\nRoll a die 🎲\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n{1, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 6}, {2}, {3, 4, 5, 6}, …\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n\n\n\n Set Concept: Example of Rolling a six-side balanced die\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDraw a Venn Diagram every time you get stuck! Venn diagram is a very useful tool for identifying a set, so I encourage you to draw a venn diagram when you get stuck on complicated set operations.\n\n\n\n\n The complement  of an event (set) \\(A\\), is denoted  \\(A^c\\) . It is the set of all outcomes (elements) of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) in which \\(A\\) does not occur. For the die example, let \\(A\\) be an event that a number greater than 2 is rolled. Then \\(A = \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) and \\(A^c = \\{1, 2\\}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  union \\((A \\cup B)\\)  is the set of all outcomes of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) in \\(A\\) or \\(B\\).  For the die example, let \\(B\\) be an event that an even number is rolled. Then \\(B = \\{2, 4, 6\\}\\) and \\(A \\cup B = \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).  Basically, as long as an element is in either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\), not necessarily in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the element is collected in the set \\((A \\cup B)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  intersection \\((A \\cap B)\\)  is the set of all outcomes of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).  For the die example, \\(A \\cap B = \\{4, 6\\}\\). Basically, for any element in the set \\((A \\cap B)\\), it must be an element of \\(A\\) and of \\(B\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint or mutually exclusive if they have no outcomes in common \\((A \\cap B = \\emptyset)\\). \\(\\emptyset\\) means an empty set, \\(\\{\\}\\), i.e., no elements in the set. If the two events are disjoint, it means that they cannot occur at the same time for one single trial of the experiment.  For the die example, let \\(C\\) be an event that an odd number is obtained. Then \\(C = \\{1, 3, 5\\}\\) and \\(B \\cap C = \\emptyset\\).  When we roll a die one time, we cannot get a number that is odd and even at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe containment \\((A \\subset B)\\) means every elements of \\(A\\) also belongs to \\(B\\). In other words, if \\(A\\) occurs, then so does \\(B\\).  For the die example, let \\(B\\) be the event that an even number is obtained and \\(D\\) be the event that a number greater than 1 is obtained. Then \\(B = \\{2, 4, 6\\}\\) and \\(D = \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).  In this case, every even number is greater than one, therefore \\(B\\) is a subset of \\(D\\), i.e., \\(B \\subset D\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that every event (set) being considered is a subset of the sample space \\((\\mathcal{S})\\) because it only makes sense to discuss the events that are possibly to be occurred. As a result, for any event \\(A\\), \\(A \\subset \\mathcal{S}\\).\n\n\n\n Probability Rules \nWe have learned how to represent an event in terms of sets and set operations. Here we are going to learn several probability rules for events.\nFirst, we denote the probability of an event \\(A\\) on a sample space \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) as \\(P(A)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTreat the probability of an event as the area of the event in the Venn diagram.\n\n\nIn order to have a coherent and logically consistent set of probability rules, we need some axioms that are self-evident to anyone. The three axioms are as follows.\n\n\\(P(\\mathcal{S}) = 1\\)\nFor any event \\(A\\), \\(P(A) \\ge 0\\)\n\nIf \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint or mutually exclusive, \\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\\)\n\n\nIf we treat the sample space as an event, the probability of the entire sample space is always equal to one because this event must happen every time the experiment is conducted. In the Venn diagram, the sample space is the entire rectangle, and in probability, we presume the area of the rectangle is one.\nBecause any event is a collection of some outcomes that could possibly occur or not occur, its probability is greater than or equal to zero. Any probability cannot be negative. It is clearly shown in terms of Venn diagram because an area of any shape of an object is greater than or equal to zero.\nFinally, if the two events are disjoint, the probability of the union of the two is just the sum of their own probability. For example, if the probability of getting a green M&M is 20% and that of getting a blue M&M is 15%, then the probability of getting a green or blue M&M is 20% + 15% = 35%. It is clearly shown in the Venn diagram too because the total area of the two disjoint events in the sample space is the sum of the individual area.\nWith the three axioms, the entire probability operation system can be constructed. Some basic properties are listed here.\n\n\n\\(P(\\emptyset) = 0\\).\n\\(0 \\le P(A) \\le 1\\)\n\nAddition Rule: \\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\\)\n\n\\(P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)\\)\nIf \\(A \\subset B\\), then \\(P(A) \\le P(B)\\)\n\n\nThe empty set does not contain any possible outcomes of an experiment. Because some outcome must be occurred after an experiment is conducted, it is impossible for some event to happen without any outcome involved. Therefore, the probability of the empty set is zero. In terms of Venn diagram, an empty set is a set with area zero because it does not occupy any part (outcome) of the entire sample space.\nSince every event being considered must be a subset of the sample space, the area of any event is smaller than the area of the sample space which is one. Therefore, for any event \\(A\\), \\(P(A) \\le 1\\). \\(P(A) = 1\\) if and only if \\(A = \\mathcal{S}\\).\n\n\nThe addition rule can be clearly understood using the Venn diagram. Figure 7.1 shows how \\(P(A \\cup B)\\) is expressed by \\(P(A)\\), \\(P(B)\\) and \\(P(A \\cap B)\\). To get the area of \\(A \\cup B\\), we can first consider the sum of the area of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the left and right circles. However, the middle part which is \\(A \\cap B\\) is counted twice when we take the sum, so the one piece of area of \\(A \\cap B\\) should be removed from the sum of the area.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Venn Diagram depiction of the addition rule\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the third axiom is a special case of the addition rule. Figure 7.2 illustrates the case. Since the two events are disjoint, \\(A \\cap B = \\emptyset\\), and the area of \\(A \\cap B\\), or \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) is zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Venn Diagram depiction of the addition rule for the disjoint case\n\n\n\n\nSince \\(A \\cup A^c = \\mathcal{S}\\) and \\(A \\cap A^c = \\emptyset\\), we have \\[P(A \\cup A^c) = P(\\mathcal{S}) = P(A) + P(A^c)\\] Therefore, \\(P(A) + P(A^c) = 1\\) and \\(P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)\\).\nIf \\(A \\subset B\\), the area of \\(A\\) is smaller or equal to the area of \\(B\\). Therefore, \\(P(A) \\le P(B)\\).\n Example: M&M Colors\n\nThe makers of the M&Ms report that their plain M&Ms are composed of\n\n15% Yellow, 10% Red, 20% Orange, 25% Blue, 15% Green and 15% Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Unsplash: Robert Anasch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you randomly select an M&M, what is the probability of the following?\n\n\n\n\nIt is brown.\nIt is red or green.\nIt is not blue.\nIt is red and brown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\\(P(\\mathrm{Brown}) = 0.15\\)\n\\(\\begin{align} P(\\mathrm{Red} \\cup \\mathrm{Green}) &= P(\\mathrm{Red}) + P(\\mathrm{Green}) - P(\\mathrm{Red} \\cap \\mathrm{Green}) \\\\ &= 0.10 + 0.15 - 0 = 0.25 \\end{align}\\)\n\\(P(\\text{Not Blue}) = 1 - P(\\text{Blue}) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75\\)\n\\(P(\\text{Red and Brown}) = P(\\emptyset) = 0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich interpretation of probability is used in this question?"

    "text": "7.2 Conditional Probability and Independence\n Conditional Probability \nQuite often people are interested in the probability of something happening given the fact that some other event has been occurred or some information about the experiment or its outcomes have been known. In this case, we can calculate the conditional probability that takes the occurred event or known information into account. The conditional probability would be more appropriate for quantifying uncertainty about what we are interested because knowing some event being occurred is a piece of valuable information that helps us properly adjust the chance of something happening.\nBy definition, the conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\) is \\[ P(A \\mid  B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}.\\]\nThe vertical bar “\\(\\mid\\)” is read as given or conditional on. Therefore, we consider the event \\(A\\) not in the entire sample space, but the event \\(A\\) that is conditional on the event \\(B\\), or \\(A \\mid B\\). In other words, we don’t consider all possible parts of \\(A\\). Instead, we only care about the part of \\(A\\) for which \\(B\\) has already occurred.\nThe formula is well defined when \\(P(B) > 0\\) and undefined if \\(P(B) = 0\\). Intuitively, one cannot calculate the probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\) when \\(B\\) is not occurred by any chance. Figure 7.3 illustrates the conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\) using the Venn diagram. When we compute the probability of \\(A\\), the information about \\(B\\) have been given, and the probability of \\(A\\) is adjusted, according to this information. The conditional probability is the ratio of \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) to \\(P(B)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Venn Diagram illustration of the conditional probability of A given B\n\n\n\n\nSo what is the difference between \\(P(A)\\) and \\(P(A \\mid B)\\)? How knowing event \\(B\\) occurred affects the probability of \\(A\\)? Well, Figure 7.4 describes the difference. When we calculate \\(P(A)\\), we assume we don’t have any specific information at hand. What we can base on is the entire sample space because we need to take all possible outcomes into account, and see if any outcome is related to the event \\(A\\). Therefore, although we just write \\(P(A)\\), the probability is actually calculated conditional on the entire sample space, i.e., \\(P(A \\mid \\mathcal{S})\\), which is the ratio of area of \\(A\\) to the area of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) that is one. Such probability is usually called unconditional or marginal probability because being conditional on \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is like being not conditional on some specific event, and “marginal” means all other possible events or outcomes have been “marginalized” out, and only event \\(A\\) is of our interest.\nNow if we know \\(B\\) has occurred, we don’t need to consider the entire sample space any more. Instead, we can focus only on \\(B\\) since we know \\(B\\) has occurred, and anything not related to \\(B\\), or \\(B^c\\) becomes irrelevant. We shrink the search pool from \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) to the smaller space \\(B\\). To find \\(P(A \\mid B)\\), we just need to find how large part of \\(B\\) that also belongs to \\(A\\). Intuitively speaking, the event \\(B\\) has become our new sample space that are smaller than the original \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). We calculate the probability of \\(A\\) based on \\(B\\), not \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). Since \\(B\\) is the new sample space, we can treat \\(P(B)\\) as one. In other words, any probability conditional on \\(B\\) is scaled up by \\(1 / P(B)\\) so that \\(P(B) \\times \\frac{1}{P(B)} = 1\\). This is why \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) is multiplied by \\(1 / P(B)\\) in the conditional probability formula.\nHere is an example of new sample space or search pool. Suppose we would like to calculate the probability of a woman who is greater than 20 years old in a certain area. When we don’t have any background information about the woman, to compute the probability, we need to base on the entire female population of interest. But if we do know that the woman has two children, we shrink our focus on the pool of women who have two children, and compute the proportion of the women pool that is over 20 years of age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Difference Between \\(P(A)\\) and \\(P(A \\mid B)\\)\n\n\n\n\nThe conditional probability formula lead to the multiplication rule: \\[P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid  B)P(B) = P(B \\mid  A)P(A)\\] The rule is a rearranged form of the formula by multiplying both sides by \\(P(B)\\). Notice that \\(P(B \\mid A) = \\frac{P(B \\cap A)}{P(A)}\\) and hence \\(P(B \\mid A)P(A) = P(B \\cap A) = P(A \\cap B)\\).\n Example: Peanut Butter and Jelly\n\nSuppose 80% of people like peanut butter, 89% like jelly and 78% like both. Given that a randomly sampled person likes peanut butter, what is the probability that she also likes jelly?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want \\(P(J\\mid PB) = \\frac{P(PB \\cap J)}{P(PB)}\\).\nFrom the problem we have \\(P(PB) = 0.8\\), \\(P(J) = 0.89\\) and \\(P(PB \\cap J) = 0.78\\)\n\n\\(P(J\\mid PB) = \\frac{P(PB \\cap J)}{P(PB)} = \\frac{0.78}{0.8} = 0.975\\)\nIf we don’t know if the person loves peanut butter, the probability that he or she loves jelly is 89%.\nIf we do know she loves peanut butter, the probability that he or she loves jelly is going up to 97.5%.\n\n\n\n\n Independence \nIn the previous example, we learn that whether a person loves peanut butter affects the probability that she loves jelly. This piece of information is relevant, and the two events “love peanut butter” and “love jelly” are dependent each other because the one event will affect the chance of the other event happening. Uncovering the association or dependence is important for statistical inference because it helps statisticians better pin down the probability of being interest.\nFormally speaking, event \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent if \\(\\begin{align} P(A \\mid B) &= P(A) \\text{ or }\\\\ P(B \\mid A) &= P(B) \\text{ or } \\\\P(A\\cap B) &= P(A)P(B)\\end{align}\\) \\(\\text{ for } P(A) > 0 \\text{ and } P(B) > 0.\\)\nIntuitively, this means that knowing \\(B\\) occurs does not change the probability that \\(A\\) occurs and vice versa. The information about \\(B\\) is irrelevant to probability of \\(A\\).\nHere is a question. Can we compute \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) if we only know \\(P(A)\\) and \\(P(B)\\) with no information other than sample space? The answer is no. We cannot compute \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) because we don’t know if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent. We can only do so if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent. In general, we need to consider the dependence of two events and use the multiplication rule \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B)P(B)\\).\nFigure 7.5 explain independence using the Venn diagram. Independence means that the ratio of area of \\(A\\) to area of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is the same as the ratio of area of \\(A \\cap B\\) to area of \\(B\\). Look at the case of non-independence on the right, the two events (circles) in particular. The area of \\(A \\cap B\\) is very close to the area of \\(B\\) because the two events are quite overlapped each other. It means that the ratio of area of \\(A \\cap B\\) to area of \\(B\\) is pretty close to one. So if we know \\(B\\) has occurred, there will be a very high chance that \\(A\\) would happen as well. In this case, the information about \\(B\\) does matter, and affect probability of \\(A\\). The idea is that the two events describe pretty much similar set of outcomes for an experiment. As a result, when one occurs, we are pretty sure the other happens as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: Venn Diagram Explanation of Independence\n\n\n\n\n Independence Example \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming that events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent and that \\(P(A) = 0.3\\) and \\(P(B) = 0.7\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(P(A \\cap B)\\)?\n\n\\(P(A \\cup B)\\)?\n\n\\(P(A \\mid B)\\)?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)=0.21\\)\n\\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\\cap B) = 0.3+0.7-0.21=0.79\\)\n\\(P(A \\mid B) = P(A) = 0.3\\)"

    "section": "\n7.3 Bayes’ Formula",
    "text": "7.3 Bayes’ Formula\nBayes’ formula is one of the most important theorems in the probability and statistical theory. It is the basis of Bayesian inference and Bayesian machine learning discussed in Chapter 21, which is getting more and more popular these days due to fast computation technology. In this section, we learn why we need the Bayes’s formula, and how we can use it to obtain the probability we are interested.\n Why Bayes’ Formula? \nQuite often, we know \\(P(B \\mid A)\\), but we are much more interested in \\(P(A \\mid B)\\). Let’s take COVID diagnostic test as an example. Suppose you are having a sore throat and muscle and headache, and you decide to test if you got COVID. Of course, any test may not be 100% accurate. A person who does get COVID may be tested negative, which is called false negative, and a person who doesn’t get COVID may get a positive testing result, false positive in this case. With lots of trials, we can have false negative rate \\(P(\\text{test negative} \\mid \\text{COVID})\\) and false positive rate \\(P(\\text{test positive} \\mid \\text{not COVID})\\) of some COVID test.\nLet me ask you a question. Suppose that during a doctor’s visit, you tested positive for COVID. If you only get to ask the doctor one question, which would it be?\n\nWhat’s the chance that I actually have COVID?\nIf in fact I don’t have COVID, what’s the chance that I would’ve gotten this positive test result?\n\nIf I were you, I would choose a. because I care more about whether I got COVID or not, not the efficacy of the test! In fact, diagnostic tests provide \\(P(\\text{test positive} \\mid \\text{COVID})\\) and \\(P(\\text{test positive} \\mid \\text{not COVID})\\), but what we are really interested is \\(P(\\text{COVID} \\mid \\text{test positive})\\)!\nSo, how can we utilize the diagnostic test efficacy to get the chance that one actually gets COVID? Bayes’ formula is the answer. It provides a way to find \\(P(A \\mid B)\\) from \\(P(B \\mid A)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Unsplash Martin Sanchez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Formula \nThe Bayes’ formula comes from the conditional probability. If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are events whose probability is not zero or one, then the Bayes’ formula is derived as below. \\[\\begin{align*} P(A \\mid B) &= \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\quad ( \\text{def. of cond. prob.}) \\\\ &= \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P((B \\cap A) \\cup (B \\cap A^c))} \\quad ( \\text{partition } B) \\\\ &= \\frac{P(B \\mid A)P(A)}{P(B \\mid A)P(A) + P(B \\mid A^c)P(A^c)}  \\quad ( \\text{multiplication rule}) \\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: Venn Diagram illustration for Bayes’ formula\n\n\n\n\nThe first equality is just the definition of conditional probability. For the second equality, we partition \\(B\\) into \\((B \\cap A)\\) and \\((B \\cap A^c)\\) as \\((B \\cap A) \\cup (B \\cap A^c) = B\\) and \\((B \\cap A)\\) and \\((B \\cap A^c)\\) are disjoint, as illustrated in Figure 7.6. 1 Since \\((B \\cap A)\\) and \\((B \\cap A^c)\\) are disjoint, \\(P((B \\cap A) \\cup (B \\cap A^c)) = P(B \\cap A) + P(B \\cap A^c)\\). Finally, we can use the multiplication rule to write \\(P(B \\cap A)\\) as \\(P(B \\mid A)P(A)\\) and \\(P(B \\cap A^c)\\) as \\(P(B \\mid A^c)P(A^c)\\). The derivation of the Bayes’ formula is complete.\nNotice that we use the information about \\(P(B \\mid A)\\), \\(P(B \\mid A^c)\\), \\(P(A)\\) and \\(P(A^c)\\) to obtain \\(P(A \\mid B)\\). In general, \\(P(A \\mid B) \\ne P(A \\mid B)\\), and they are completely different probabilities.

    "section": "\n9.2 Binomial Distribution",
    "text": "9.2 Binomial Distribution\n Binomial Experiment and Random Variable \nBinomial distribution is generated from the so-called binomial experiment that has the following properties:\n\n👉 The experiment consists of a fixed number of identical trials, say \\(n\\). That is, \\(n\\) is pre-specified before the experiment is conducted, and remains unchanged while the experiment is in progress. Also, all the trials or repetitions in the experiment should be performed with exactly the same condition or procedure.\n👉 Each trial results in one of exactly two outcomes. In practice, we use success (S) and failure (F) to represent the two outcomes. The word success just means one of the two outcomes and does not necessarily mean something good. 😲 Depending on your research question, you could define Drug abuse as success and No drug abuse as failure.\n👉 Trials are independent, meaning that the outcome of one trial does not affect the outcome of any other trial.\n👉 The probability of success, say \\(\\pi\\), is constant for all trials.\n\nIf a binomial experiment is conducted, and \\(X\\) is defined as  the number of successes observed in \\(n\\) trials , then \\(X\\) is a binomial random variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n Distribution \nThe probability function \\(P(X = x)\\) of a binomial variable \\(X\\) can be fully determined by the number of trials \\(n\\) and the probability of success \\(\\pi\\). Once \\(n\\) and \\(\\pi\\) are fixed and known, we know exactly what the distribution looks like, and we can form a table, graph, and provide a mathematical formula of the binomial probability function. A different \\((n, \\pi)\\) pair generates a different binomial probability distribution. The value(s) that determines an entire probability distribution is called the parameter of the distribution. Therefore, \\(X\\) is said to follow a binomial distribution with parameters \\(n\\) and \\(\\pi\\), written as \\(\\color{blue}{X \\sim binomial(n, \\pi)}\\).\nThe binomial probability function is \\[ \\color{blue}{P(X = x \\mid n, \\pi) = \\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}\\pi^x(1-\\pi)^{n-x}, \\quad x = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, n}\\]\nIt is not that important to memorize the formula as nowadays we use computing software to obtain \\(P(X = x)\\) for any \\(x\\). Notice that the maximal possible number of \\(x\\) is \\(n\\), the number of trials. We cannot have 5 successes when there are only 4 trials in the experiment. Second, when both \\(n\\) and \\(pi\\) are known and fixed, with a value of \\(x\\), everything in the formula is known, and the probability can be calculated.\nIt can be shown that the binomial distribution has mean \\(\\mu = E(X) = n\\pi\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2 = Var(X) = n\\pi(1-\\pi)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we toss a fair coin two times independently and let \\(X =\\) # of heads, is \\(X\\) a binomial random variable?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo answer this question, we need to check if the experiment satisfies the four properties.\n\nThe number of trials is 2, and the two trials, tossing a fair coin are identical (if you are not nitpicking).\nEach trial results in one of exactly two outcomes, heads or tails.\nTrials are independent. Well it’s hard to say, but at least they are nearly independent.\nThe probability of heads is 1/2 for all trials because we got a fair coin.\n\nSo, is \\(X\\) a binomial random variable? You tell me.\n Example \n\n\nAssume that 20% of all drivers have a blood alcohol level above the legal limit. For a random sample of 15 vehicles, compute the probability that:\n\nExactly 6 of the 15 drivers will exceed the legal limit.\nOf the 15 drivers, 6 or more will exceed the legal limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose it’s a binomial experiment with \\(n = 15\\) and \\(\\pi = 0.2\\). Let \\(X\\) be the number of drivers exceeding limit. Then \\(X \\sim binomial(15, 0.2)\\). Therefore,\n\\[ \\color{blue}{P(X = x \\mid n=15, \\pi=0.2) = \\frac{15!}{x!(15-x)!}(0.2)^x(1-0.2)^{15-x}, \\quad x = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, 15.}\\]\nSince we know the value of parameter \\(n\\) and \\(\\pi\\), the entire binomial distribution can be described, as shown in Figure 9.2.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Binomial Distribution Example \\(X \\sim binomial(15, 0.2).\\)\n\n\n\n\nTo answer the first question, we just need to calculate \\(P(X = 6)\\) using the formula: \\[\\small P(X = 6) = \\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}\\pi^x(1-\\pi)^{n-x} = \\frac{15!}{6!(15-6)!}(0.2)^6(1-0.2)^{15-6} = 0.043\\]\nThe second question asks for \\(P(X \\ge 6)\\) because of “6 or more will exceed the legal limit”. One can calculate the probability like \\(\\small P(X \\ge 6) = P(X = 6 \\cup X = 7 \\cup \\cdots \\cup X = 15) = p(6) + \\dots + p(15)\\). It requires 10 probability calculations. One simpler way of obtaining the probability is to consider the complement set of \\(\\{X \\ge 6\\}\\) which is \\(\\{X \\le 5\\}\\). Then use the property that \\(P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)\\) to get the answer. So we can do the following \\(P(X \\ge 6) = 1 - P(X \\le 5) = 1 - (p(0) + p(1) + \\dots + p(5)) = 0.0611\\). In this case, we only need to calculate 6 probabilities from the formula.\nWell I believe you’ve seen how tedious calculating a binomial probability is! It is so true especially when \\(n\\) is relatively large. No worries. We are living in the 21th century with lots of advancing computing technology. We’ll never do such calculation by hand, and we’ll learn to compute them using R!\n\n\n\n\n Computation in R\nIn practice, we are not gonna calculate probabilities of binomial or other commonly used probability distributions. Instead, we use computing software. In R we can use dpqr familty functions to calculate probabilities or generate values from the distributions. In general, for some distribution, short for dist, R has the following functions\n\n\nddist(x, ...): calculate density value \\(f(x)\\) or probability value \\(P(X = x)\\).\n\npdist(q, ...): calculate \\(P(X \\le q)\\).\n\nqdist(p, ...): obtain quantile of probability \\(p\\).\n\nrdist(n, ...): generate \\(n\\) random numbers.\n\nWhen we use these functions, the dist is replaced with the shortened name of the distribution we consider. For example, we use dbinom(x, ...) to do the calculation for the binomial distribution.\nThe function ddist(x, ...) gives us the probability density value \\(f(x)\\) if the distribution is continuous, and it is why the function starts with d. The continuous probability distribution will be discussed in Chapter 10 in detail. If the distribution is discrete, like binomial, it gives us the value \\(P(X = x)\\) where \\(X\\) follows the distribution being considered, and \\(x\\) is the value specified in the first argument of the function.\nFor the binomial distribution, we use dbinom(x, size, prob) to compute \\(P(X = x)\\), where size is the number of trials and prob is the probability of success. Besides \\(x\\), we need to provide the values of size and prob because remember that they are the parameters of the binomial distribution. Without them, we cannot have a specific binomial distribution, and its probability cannot be calculated.\nTo obtain \\(P(X = 6)\\) where \\(X \\sim binomial(n=15, \\pi=0.2)\\), in R, we do\n\n## 1. P(X = 6)\ndbinom(x = 6, size = 15, prob = 0.2) \n\n[1] 0.04299262\n\n\nTo answer the second question \\(P(X \\ge 6)\\), we can use the function pbinom(q, size, prob) that calculates \\(P(X \\le q)\\) for \\(X \\sim bionomial(n = \\texttt{size}, \\pi = \\texttt{prob})\\). Notice that \\(P(X >= 6) = 1 - P(X <= 5)\\), so in R, we can do\n\n## 2. P(X >= 6) = 1 - P(X <= 5)\n1 - pbinom(q = 5, size = 15, prob = 0.2) \n\n[1] 0.06105143\n\n\nBy default, the function pbinom(q, size, prob) calculates the probability \\(P(X \\le q)\\) which is the left or lower tail part of the distribution. The function provides an argument lower.tail that is logical, and is TRUE by default. When we set lower.tail = FALSE in the function, it will instead calculate \\(P(X > q)\\) which is the right or upper tail part of the distribution. Since \\(P(X \\ge 6) = P(X > 5)\\), in R we can do\n\n## 2. P(X >= 6) = P(X > 5)\npbinom(q = 5, size = 15, prob = 0.2, lower.tail = FALSE) \n\n[1] 0.06105143\n\n\nNotice that we use q = 5 instead of q = 6 because we want \\(P(X > 5)\\). Also, lower.tail = FALSE is added into the function, and the probability value is the same as the value before.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an example of how to generate the binomial probability distribution as a graph.\n\nplot(x = 0:15, y = dbinom(0:15, size = 15, prob = 0.2), \n     type = 'h', xlab = \"x\", ylab = \"P(X = x)\", \n     lwd = 5, main = \"Binomial(15, 0.2)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere a sequence of integers 0 to 15 are created and put in the x-axis. Then dbinom(0:15, size = 15, prob = 0.2) is used to create probabilities of \\(binomial(15, 0.2)\\) for each integer. The vertical bar geometry comes from the argument type = 'h' standing for “histogram”.1\nSince \\(n = 15\\) and \\(\\pi = 0.2\\), the mean is \\((15)(0.2) = 3\\). For the binomial distribution, it means that the number of success is more likely to be happened around \\(x = 3\\). It is very uncommon to see that more than 10 drivers have alcohol level above the legal limit."

    "text": "9.3 Poisson Distribution\n Poisson Random Variables \nIf we want to count the number of occurrences of some event2 over a unit of time or space/region/volume and observe its associated probability, we could consider the Poisson distribution. For example,\n\nThe number of COVID patients arriving at ICU in one hour\nThe number of Marquette students logging onto D2L in one day\nThe number of dandelions per square meter on Marquette’s campus\n\nLet \\(X\\) be a Poisson random variable. Then \\(\\color{blue}{X \\sim Poisson(\\lambda)}\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is the parameter representing the mean number of occurrences of the event in some time interval or region. The Poisson probability function is\n\\[\\color{blue}{P(X = x \\mid \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^x e^{-\\lambda}}{x!}, \\quad x = 0, 1, 2, \\dots}\\]\nAgain, the parameter \\(\\lambda\\) determines the shape of the distribution. The constant \\(e\\) is the Euler’s number that is approximately \\(2.7182818284\\). \\(x! = x \\times (x-1) \\times \\cdots \\times 2 \\times 1\\) and \\(0! = 1\\). Note that the possible value of \\(x\\) could be any positive integer. Theoretically speaking, there is no upper limit for the number of occurrences of any event. No worries. You don’t need to memorize the formula, but it’s good to recognize it.\nOne interesting property of the Poisson distribution is that its mean and variance are both equal to its parameter \\(\\lambda\\). So a \\(Poisson(5)\\) distribution has mean and variance being equal to 5.\n\n\n Assumptions and Properties of Poisson Variables \nAs the binomial distribution, the Poisson distribution comes from the Poisson experiment having the following properties and assumptions:\n\n👉 Events occur one at a time; two or more events do not occur at the same time or in the same space or spot. For example, one cannot say two patients arrived at ICU at the same time. There must be a way to separate one event from the other, and one can always know which patient arrives at ICU earlier.\n👉 The occurrence of an event in a given period of time or region of space is independent of the occurrence of the event in a nonoverlapping time period or region of space. For example, number of patients arriving at ICU between 2 PM and 3 PM has nothing to do with the number of patients arriving at ICU between 8 PM and 9 PM because the two time periods have no overlap.\n👉 \\(\\lambda\\) is constant for any period or region. For example, the mean number of patients arriving at ICU between 2 PM and 3 PM is the same as the mean number of patients arriving at ICU between 8 PM and 9 PM. This assumption is pretty strong, and usually violated in reality. If you want to use Poisson distribution to build your statistical model, use it with additional care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the differences between Binomial and Poisson distributions?\n\n\n\nThe Poisson distribution\n\nis determined by one single parameter \\(\\lambda\\)\nhas possible values \\(x = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\\) with no upper limit (countable), while a binomial variable has possible values \\(0, 1, 2, \\dots, n\\) (finite)\n\n\n\n\n Example \n\n\nLast year there were 4200 births at the University of Wisconsin Hospital. Let \\(X\\) be the number of births in a given day at the center, and assume \\(X \\sim Poisson(\\lambda)\\). Find\n\n\\(\\lambda\\), the mean number of births per day.\nthe probability that on a randomly selected day, there are exactly 10 births.\n\\(P(X > 10)\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Unsplash kaushal mishra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\small \\lambda = \\frac{\\text{Number of birth in a year}}{\\text{Number of days}} = \\frac{4200}{365} = 11.5.\\) There are totally 4200 births in one year, so on average there are 11.5 per day. According to how we define \\(X\\), the time unit is a day, not a year. The parameter \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(X\\) should have the same time unit.\n\\(\\small P(X = 10 \\mid \\lambda = 11.5) = \\frac{\\lambda^x e^{-\\lambda}}{x!} = \\frac{11.5^{10} e^{-11.5}}{10!} = 0.113.\\)\n\\(\\small P(X > 10) = p(11) + p(12) + \\dots + p(20) + \\dots\\) (No end!) \\(\\small P(X > 10) = 1 - P(X \\le 10) = 1 - (p(1) + p(2) + \\dots + p(10))\\).\n\nDid you see how tedious it is to calculate the Poisson probabilities even using a calculator? I know you are waiting for R implementation!\n\n Computation in R \n\n\nInstead of using dbinom() and pbinom(), for Poisson distribution, we replace binom with pois, and use dpois(x, lambda) and ppois(q, lambda) to calculate the probabilities.\nWith lambda being the mean of Poisson distribution, and \\(X\\sim Poisson(\\lambda)\\), we\n\nuse dpois(x, lambda) to compute \\(P(X = x \\mid \\lambda)\\)\nuse ppois(q, lambda) to compute \\(P(X \\le q \\mid \\lambda)\\)\nuse ppois(q, lambda, lower.tail = FALSE) to compute \\(P(X > q \\mid \\lambda)\\)\n\n\n# 1.\n(lam <- 4200 / 365)\n\n[1] 11.50685\n\n## 2. P(X = 10)\ndpois(x = 10, lambda = lam)  \n\n[1] 0.112834\n\n\n\n## 3.\n## P(X > 10) = 1 - P(X <= 10)\n1 - ppois(q = 10, lambda = lam)  \n\n[1] 0.5990436\n\n## P(X > 10)\nppois(q = 10, lambda = lam, \n      lower.tail = FALSE) \n\n[1] 0.5990436\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an example of how to generate the Poisson probability distribution as a graph.\n\nplot(0:24, dpois(0:24, lambda = lam), type = 'h', \n     lwd = 5, ylab = \"P(X = x)\", xlab = \"x\", \n     main = \"Poisson(11.5)\")\n\n\n\n\nBe careful that the Poisson \\(X\\) has no upper limit; the graph is truncated at \\(x = 24\\). Strictly speaking, the graph does not accurately display the \\(Poisson(11.5)\\) distribution. Since the mean is 11.5, we know that it is very unlikely to have a very large \\(x\\), that is \\(P(X = x)\\) is very close to zero for \\(x > 25\\). As the binomial distribution, the number of occurrences is more likely to be around its mean number 11.5, and the chance is decaying as the number is away from the mean."

    "section": "\n10.1 Introduction",
    "text": "10.1 Introduction\nUnlike a discrete random variable taking finite or countable values, a continuous random variable takes on any values from an interval of the real number line. For example, a continuous random variable \\(X\\) could take any value in the unit interval \\([0, 1]\\). Its possible values are uncountable.\nInstead of probability functions, a continuous random variable \\(X\\) has the probability density function (pdf) denoted \\(f(x)\\) such that for any real value \\(a < b\\), \\[P(a < X < b) = \\int_{a}^b f(x) dx.\\]\nThe probability that \\(X\\) is in some interval is computed from the integral of the density function with respect to \\(x\\). Keep in mind that the density function \\(f(x)\\) itself is not the probability that \\(X = x\\). The probability of continuous random variables is defined through the integral of \\(f(x)\\).\nThe cumulative distribution function (cdf) of \\(X\\) is defined as \\[F(x) := P(X \\le x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f(t)dt.\\]\n😎 Luckily, we don’t calculate integrals in this course. You just need to remember that for continuous random variables,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nThe pdf does not represent a probability.\nThe integral of pdf represents a probability.\nThe cdf itself by definition is a probability that is also from the integral of pdf.\n\n\n\nEvery probability density function must satisfy the two properties:\n\n\\(f(x) \\ge 0\\) for all \\(x\\) on the real line\n\\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) dx = 1\\)\n\n\\(f(x)\\) is a density value. For property 1, like density used in Physics, it cannot be negative. The density here represents how much likely the random variable \\(X\\) is around the value \\(x\\). When \\(f(x) = 0\\), it means that it is not possible to have \\(X\\) having value in the tiny neighborhood around \\(x\\). On the other hand, when \\(f(x)\\) is large, it is pretty likely to have \\(X\\) having values around \\(x\\). Because \\(f(x)\\) is the integrand, a larger value of \\(f(x)\\) in the interval \\([a, b]\\) will lead to a larger probability \\(P(a < X < b)\\).\nThe second property tells us that \\(P(-\\infty < X < \\infty) = 1\\). Remember that a random variable, whether it is discrete or continuous, must take a real value. Therefore the probability that \\(X\\) lives on the entire real line \\((-\\infty, \\infty)\\) is one.\nIn fact, any function satisfying the two properties can be served as a probability density function for some random variable.\n\n Density Curve \nA probability density function generates a graph called a density curve that shows the likelihood of a random variable at all possible values. Figure 10.1 shows an example of density curve colored in blue. From Calculus 101, we have two important findings:\n\nThe integral of \\(f(x)\\) between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is actually the area under the density curve between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the area under the density curve represents the probability \\(P(a < X < b) = \\int_{a}^b f(x) dx\\), the density value \\(f(x)\\), or the height of the density curve does not.\nThe total area under any density curve is equal to 1: \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) dx = 1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Density curve for a random variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that the area under the density curve represents probability, not the density value or the height of the density curve at some value of \\(x\\).\nOne question is for a continuous random variable \\(X\\), what is the probability that \\(X\\) equals any real number, or \\(P(X = a)\\) for any \\(a \\in \\mathbf{R}\\)? Since \\(P(X = a) = P(a \\le X \\le a) = \\int_{a}^a f(x) dx = 0\\), we know that \\(P(X = a) = 0\\) for any real number \\(a\\). Graphically speaking, it means that there is no area under the density curve between \\(a\\) and \\(a\\).\nTherefore, for a continuous random variable \\(X\\), \\(P(a \\le X\\le b) = P(a < X < b)\\) for any real value \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) because there is no probability mass on \\(x = a\\) and \\(x = b\\).\n\n\n\n Commonly Used Continuous Distributions \n\nThere are tons of continuous distributions out there, and we won’t be able to discuss all of them. In this book, we will touch on normal (Gaussian), student’s t, chi-square, and F distributions. Some other popular distributions include uniform, exponential, gamma, beta, inverse gamma, Cauchy, etc. If you are interested in learning more distributions and their properties, please take a calculus-based probability theory course."

When \\(\\mu = 0\\) and \\(\\sigma = 1\\), \\(N(0, 1)\\) is called standard normal.\nFigure 10.2 are examples of normal density curves and how they change with different means and standard deviations. The normal distribution is always bell-shaped and symmetric about the mean \\(\\mu\\), regardless of the value of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). The parameter \\(\\mu\\) is the location parameter that controls the “location” of the distribution. The navy \\(N(100, 10^2)\\) is 80 units right of the red \\(N(20, 10^2)\\). The parameter \\(\\sigma\\) is the scale parameter that determines the variability or spreadness of the distribution.

Since the total area under the density curve is always one, to account for large variation, the density curve of \\(N(100, 15^2)\\) has heavier tails and lower density values around the mean. Heavier tails means it is more probable to have extreme values like 130 or 70 that are away from the mean 100, comparing to \\(N(100, 10^2)\\) with smaller variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Normal density curves with varying means and standard deviations"

    "text": "10.3 Standardization and Z-Scores\nStandardization is a transformation that allows us to convert any normal distribution \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) to \\(N(0, 1)\\), the standard normal distribution.\nWhy do we want to perform standardization? We want to put data on a standardized scale, because it helps us make comparisons more easily. Later we will see why. Let’s first see how we can do standardization.\nIf \\(x\\) is an observation from a distribution, not necessarily normal, with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), the standardized value of \\(x\\) is called \\(z\\)-score: \\[z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\nThe \\(z\\)-score tells us how many standard deviations \\(x\\) falls away from its mean and in which direction.\n\nObservations larger than the mean have positive \\(z\\)-scores.\nObservations smaller than the mean have negative \\(z\\)-scores.\nA \\(z\\)-score -1.2 means that \\(x\\) is 1.2 standard deviations to the left of or below the mean.\nA \\(z\\)-score 1.8 means that \\(x\\) is 1.8 standard deviations to the right of or above the mean.\n\n If \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), then \\(Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\), the transformed random variable, follows the standard normal distribution \\(Z \\sim N(0, 1)\\). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAny transformation of a random variable is still a random variable but with a different probability distribution.\n\n\n\n Graphical Illustration \nWhat does the standardization really do? Well it first subtracts the original variable value \\(x\\) from the mean \\(\\mu\\), then divided by its standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\).\n\nFirst, \\(X - \\mu\\) shifts the mean from \\(\\mu\\) to 0. Figure 10.3 illustrates this. The original distribution is \\(X \\sim N(3, 4)\\) (navy). Then the new variable \\(Y = X-\\mu\\) is \\(Y = X - 3\\) that follows \\(N(0, 4)\\) distribution (blue). \\(X - \\mu\\) means the distribution is shifted to the left 3 units, so that the new location or center becomes zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Standardization shifts mean from 3 to 0\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, \\(\\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\) scales the variation from 4 to 1. \\(Y = X-3 \\sim N(0, 4).\\) Because \\(\\sigma = 2\\), \\(Z = \\frac{X - 3}{2} \\sim N(0, 1)\\). The idea is that one unit change in \\(X\\) is one unit change in \\(Y\\), but just 1/2 unit change in \\(Z\\). Through dividing by \\(\\sigma\\), the variation measured in the new scale becomes smaller, and the new variance is one. For any normal variable with an arbitrary finite value of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\), the variable after standardization will always follow \\(N(0, 1)\\) (red).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.4: Standardization scales variance from 4 to 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf \\(\\sigma < 1\\), then the variation measured in the new scale becomes larger, because the new variance is one.\n\n\nA value of \\(x\\) that is 2 standard deviation below the mean, \\(\\mu\\), corresponds to \\(z = -2\\). For any \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\), \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) have a one-to-one correspondence relationship: \\(z = \\frac{x -\\mu}{\\sigma} \\iff x = \\mu + z\\sigma\\). So if \\(z = -2\\), \\(x = \\mu - 2\\sigma\\). Figure 10.5 depicts how the values on the x-axis change when standardization is performed.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.5: Standardized Normal Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n SAT and ACT Example (OS Example 4.2) \nStandardization can help us compare the performance of students on the SAT and ACT, which both have nearly normal distributions. The table below lists the parameters for each distribution.\n\n\nMeasure\nSAT\nACT\n\n\n\nMean\n1100\n21\n\n\nSD\n200\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose Anna scored a 1300 on her SAT and Tommy scored a 24 on his ACT. We want to determine whether Anna or Tommy performed better on their respective tests.\n Standardization \nSince SAT and ACT are measured on a different scale, we are not able to compare the two scores unless we measure them using the same scale. What we do is standardization. Both SAT and ACT are normally distributed but with different mean and variance. We first transform the two distributions into the standard normal distribution, then examining Anna and Tommys’ performance by checking the location of their score on the standard normal distribution.\nThe idea is that we first measure the two scores using the same scale and unit. The new transformed score in both cases is how many standard deviations the original score is away from its original mean. That is, both SAT and ACT are measured using the z-score. Then if A’s z-score is larger than B’ z-score, we know that A performs better than B because A has a relatively higher score than B.\nThe z-score of Anna and Tommy is \\(z_{A} = \\frac{x_{A} - \\mu_{SAT}}{\\sigma_{SAT}} = \\frac{1300-1100}{200} = 1\\); \\(z_{T} = \\frac{x_{T} - \\mu_{ACT}}{\\sigma_{ACT}} = \\frac{24-21}{6} = 0.5\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.6: SAT and ACT distribution\n\n\n\n\nThis standardization tells us that Anna scored 1 standard deviation above the mean and Tommy scored 0.5 standard deviations above the mean. From this information, we can conclude that Anna performed better on the SAT than Tommy performed on the ACT.\nFigure 10.6 shows the SAT and ACT distributions. Note that the two distributions are depicted using the same density curve, as if they are measured on the same scale or standard normal distribution. Clearly we can see that Anna tends to do better with respect to everyone else than Tommy did."

Using z-scores help us write shorter R code to compute the wanted probability.\n\n Step 3: Find \\(z\\)-score \n\n \\(z = \\frac{1190 - 1100}{200} = 0.45\\) and we want to compute \\(\\begin{align*} P(X > 1190) &= P\\left( \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} > \\frac{1190 - 1000}{200} \\right) \\\\&= P(Z > 0.45) = 1 - P(Z \\le 0.45) \\end{align*}\\) \nAt this point, we obtain the target probability once we get \\(P(Z \\le 0.45)\\). The last step is to use pnorm() function to get it done.\n\n Step 4: Find the area using pnorm() \n\n\n1 - pnorm(0.45)\n\n[1] 0.3263552\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen we use R pnorm() to compute normal probabilities, standardization is not a must. However, if we don’t use z-scores, we must specify the mean and SD of the original distribution of \\(X\\), like pnorm(x, mean = mu, sd = sigma). Otherwise, R does not know which normal distribution we are considering. For example,\n\n1 - pnorm(1190, mean = 1100, sd = 200)\n\n[1] 0.3263552\n\n\nBy default, pnorm() uses the standard normal distribution assuming mean = 0 and sd = 1. So if we use z-scores to compute probabilities, we don’t need to specify the value of mean and standard deviation, and our code is shorter:\n\n1 - pnorm(0.45)\n\n[1] 0.3263552\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAny probability can be computed using the “less than” form (lower or left tail). In the previous example, we use \\(P(X \\ge 1190) = 1 - P(X < 1190)\\) expression, and we find \\(P(X < 1190)\\) that has the “less than” form.\nThis step is not necessary too, and we can directly compute \\(P(X \\ge 1190)\\) using pnorm(). However, if the calculation involves the “greater than” form, or we focus on upper or right tail part of the distribution, we need to add lower.tail = FALSE in pnorm(). For example,\n\npnorm(1190, mean = 1100, sd = 200, lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n[1] 0.3263552\n\n\nBy default, lower.tail = TRUE, and pnorm(q, ...) finds a probability \\(P(X < q)\\), the lower tail part of the distribution.\n\n\n\n Normal Percentiles in R \nQuite often we want to know what score we need to get in order to be in the top 10% of the test takers, or the minimal score we should get to be not at the bottom 20%. To answer such questions, we need to find the percentile or quantile of the underlying distribution.\n\n\nTo get the \\(100p\\)-th percentile (or the \\(p\\) quantile denoted as \\(q\\) ) of a normal distribution, given probability \\(p\\), we use\n\nqnorm(p, mean, sd) to get a value of \\(X\\), \\(q\\), such that \\(P(X \\le q) = p\\)\nqnorm(p, mean, sd, lower.tail = FALSE) to get \\(q\\) such that \\(P(X \\ge q) = p\\)\n\n SAT and ACT Example \nBack to our SAT example. What is the 95th percentile for SAT scores?\nKeep in mind that a percentile or quantile is a value of random variable \\(x\\), not a probability. When we find the quantile, its associated probability is given because the probability is the required information to obtain the quantile.\nThe first step again is to figure out what we want. If we want to find the 95th percentile, it means that we want to find the variable value \\(q\\) so that \\(P(X < q) = 0.95\\). In other words, we want to find an \\(x\\) value of the normal distribution, which is greater than 95% of all other cases.\n\n\n Step 1: State the problem \n\n We want to find \\(q\\) s.t \\(P(X < q) = 0.95\\). \n\n\n\nThe whole idea is shown graphically in Figure 10.10. We already know the percentage 95%. All we need to do is to find the value \\(q\\) so that the area left to it is 95%.\n\n Step 2: Draw a picture\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.10: Picture for the 95th percentile of SAT scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike we do in finding probabilities, we can first do the standardization for finding quantiles although it is not necessary. So we use qnorm() to find the z-score \\(z^*\\), or the value of a standard normal variable that is the 95th percentile, i.e., \\(P(Z < z^*) = 0.95\\).\n\n\n Step 3: Find \\(z\\)-score s.t. \\(P(Z < z^*) = 0.95\\) using qnorm():\n\n\n(z_95 <- qnorm(0.95))\n\n[1] 1.644854\n\n\nNow, since we are interested in the 95th percentile of SAT, not the z-score, we need to transform the 95th percentile of \\(N(0, 1)\\) back to the 95th percentile of \\(N(1100, 200^2)\\), the original SAT distribution.\n\n\n Step 4: Find the \\(x\\) of the original scale \n\n \\(z_{0.95} = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\). So \\(x = \\mu + z_{0.95}\\sigma = 1100+(1.645)\\times200 = 1429\\). \n\n\n\n\n(x_95 <- 1100 + z_95 * 200)\n\n[1] 1428.971\n\n\nTherefore, the 95th percentile for SAT scores is 1429.\nNote that we can directly find the 95th percentile of SAT without standardization. We just need to remember to stay in the original SAT distribution by explicitly specifying mean = 1100 and sd = 200 in the qnorm() function, as we do for pnorm().\n\nqnorm(p = 0.95, mean = 1100, sd = 200)\n\n[1] 1428.971"

Many statistical methods assume variables are normally distributed. Therefore, testing the appropriateness of the normal assumption is a key step.\nWe can check this normality assumption using a so-called normal quantile plot (normal probability plot) or a Quantile-Quantile plot (QQ plot).\nThe construction of the QQ plot is technical, and we don’t need to dig into that at this moment. The bottom line is if the data are (nearly) normally distributed, the points on the QQ plot will lie close to a straight line.\nIf the data are right-skewed, the points on the QQ plot will be convex-shaped. If the data are left-skewed, the points on the QQ plot will be concave-shaped.\n\n\n\n\n\n QQ plot in R \nTo generate a QQ-plot for checking normality in R, we can use qqnorm() and qqline(), where the first argument in the functions is the sample data we would like to check. Figure 10.11 shows QQ plots at the bottom for normal and right-skewed data samples. Since the data normal_sample actually come from a normal distribution, its histogram looks like normal, and its QQ plot look like a perfect straight line. On the other hand, on the right hand side we have a right skewed data set right_skewed_sample.

The entire distribution is controlled solely by the few parameters.\nIn statistics, we usually assume our target population follows some distribution, but its parameters are unknown to us. For example, we may assume human weight follows \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) although we are not quite sure what its mean and/or variance is. We may think the number of snowstorms in one year in the US follows \\(Poisson(\\lambda)\\) although we have no idea of the mean number of occurrences.\n\n\n\n Human weight \\(\\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n # of snowstorms \\(\\sim Poisson(\\lambda)\\) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Treat Each Data Point as a Random Variable \n\nA statistical data analysis more or less involves some probability. How do we bring probability into the analysis? How is the data related to probability? Here we are going to learn some insight about it. Suppose in order to do a data analysis and inference about some population characteristic, the population mean for example, we collect a sample data of size \\(n\\), a data set having \\(n\\) data points or values.\nHere is how the probability comes into play. First, we assume the target population follows some probability distribution, say \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). Then we treat each data point as a random variable whose realized value, the value shown in our collected data set, is drawn from the population distribution.\nTake Marquette students weight for example. Suppose the weight follows \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). Suppose we decide to collect ten data points, so \\(n = 10\\). Now before we actually collect the data, the ten data points are all random variables that follow \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). If we write the ten variables as \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2, \\dots, X_{10}\\), then we have \\(X_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2), i = 1, 2, \\dots, 10.\\) Notice that \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_{10}\\) all follow the same distribution because they all come from the same population. Now, after we collect our data, we have the realized value of those ten random variables. For example, out data set may look like\n\n\n134 110 177 183 144 150 95 200 145 189\n\n\nSo the realized value of \\(X_1\\) is 134, the realized value of \\(X_2\\) is 110, and so on. Each data value is drawn from the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: Illustration of sampling from a population\n\n\n\n\nIn statistics, we usually assume that \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) are independent, meaning that the value of \\(X_i\\) is not affected by any other \\(X_j, j\\ne i\\). With the same distribution, \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) are independent and identically distributed , or iid, denoted as\n\n \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N(\\mu, \\sigma^2).\\) \n\nThen we call such sample data \\((X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)\\) a random sample of size \\(n\\) from the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we actually collect the data, the data \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) are random variables from the population distribution \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\).\nOnce we collect the data, we know the realized value of these random variables: \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\)."

    "text": "11.2 Sampling Distribution\nAny value computed from a sample \\((X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)\\) is called a (sample) statistic.\n\n The sample mean \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\) is a statistic. \n Sample variance \\(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(X_i - \\overline{X}\\right)^2}{n-1}\\) is also a statistic. \n\nSince \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) are random variables, any transformation or function of \\((X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)\\) or its statistics is also a random variable. The probability distribution of a statistic is called the sampling distribution of that statistic. It is the probability distribution of that statistic if we were to repeatedly draw samples of the same size from the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the sample mean \\(\\overline{X} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\) have a sampling distribution?\n\n\n\nYes, because sample mean is a statistic, and it is a random variable! Keep in mind that before we get the realized values of data, data points are random variables. Because \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) are random, \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\) is random too. The reason why we can calculate sample mean and same variance in Chapter 5 is because we get the realized values of data. They are actual numbers, so we can do calculations.\n\n\n\n Sampling Distribution of Sample Mean \nSince \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) are random, if we repeat the sampling couple of times, every time we will be getting different realized values.\nThe following table shows 5 replicates of sample data of size 10. The first data set has 10 realized values 117 169 111 190  98  94 127 105  93 187. If we were to collect another data set, the first realized value of \\(X_1\\) could be any other number from the population, not necessarily to be 117 because again \\(X_1\\) is a random variable. In our example \\(x_1 = 192\\) in the second data set. The idea applies to \\(X_2\\) to \\(X_{10}\\). Now because every time we collect a new data set we get different realized values \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{10}\\), the realized value of sample mean will vary from sample to sample as well. The first data set gets the sample mean 129.1, the second one 153.2, and so on. This shows why the sample mean is random by nature, and its value varies according to a distribution that is its sampling distribution.\n\n\n           x1  x2  x3  x4  x5  x6  x7  x8  x9 x10  mean\nDataset-1 117 169 111 190  98  94 127 105  93 187 129.1\nDataset-2 192 175 179 159 168 167 103 145 151  93 153.2\nDataset-3  93 110 129 173 145 156 189 184 182  94 145.5\nDataset-4 155 136 129 173 137  92 176 130 189 161 147.8\nDataset-5 121 131 132  91 168 143 138 191 145 140 140.0\n\n\nFigure 11.2 illustrates how we collect the sample of sample means that represents its sampling distribution. In short, if we were able to collect lots of samples of size \\(n\\), and get the sample mean for each sample of size \\(n\\), the histogram of those sample means gives us a pretty good understanding of what the sampling distribution of the sample mean looks like.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: Sampling distribution of sample means (Biostatistics for the Biological and Health Sciences p.241)\n\n\n\n\nThe following histogram shows the sampling distribution of the sample mean for the sample of size 10 when the sampling are repeated 1000 times. That is, we have 1000 \\(\\overline{x}\\)s, each being computed from \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\sum_{i=1}^{10}x_{i}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept is a little abstract, and you may need time to digest it. The applet Sampling Distribution Applet provides animation of how the sampling distribution is formed. I highly recommend that you play with it, and figure out the entire building process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the differences between the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\) and the population distribution each individual random variable, \\(X_i\\), is drawn from?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an important question. So far we know each data point or random variable \\(X_i, i = 1, \\dots, n\\) is drawn from the population distribution. The sample mean \\(\\overline{X}\\) is also a random variable following its sampling distribution. Fo r any population distribution, not necessarily normal, \\(\\overline{X}\\) has the following two properties:\n\n\nThe sample mean \\((\\overline{X})\\) is  less variable  than an individual observation \\(X_i\\). Although \\(\\overline{X}\\) and \\(X_i\\) are both random variables, the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\) has smaller variance than \\(X_i\\). Intuitively, \\(\\overline{X}\\) is the average of bunch of \\(X_i\\)s. Averaging is washing the extreme values out, resulting in values similar to each other.\n\n\n\ndata 1: 30 40 50 60 70\n\n\ndata 2: 0 5 50 95 100\n\n\ndata 3: 0 5 10 15 220\n\n\nThe three data sets all have \\(x_1, \\dots, x_5\\). Clearly, \\(X_i\\) could generate pretty small or large values. However, when all five \\(x_1, \\dots, x_5\\) are averaged, the extreme values are combined together, moving toward to some value in between. In this example, all three data sets have the sample mean \\(50\\) with even no variation at all. The sample mean is much more stable than individual \\(X_i\\), especially when the sample size \\(n\\) is large.\n\nThe sample mean \\((\\overline{X})\\) is  more normal  than an individual observation \\(X_i\\).\n\nThe population distribution \\(X_i\\) is drawn from is not necessarily a normal distribution, and it can be any distribution that is not bell-shaped or not unimodal. However, the sampling distribution will always look more like a normal distribution than the assumed population distribution. This sounds unreal, but it is true. The important central limit theorem proves this, and we will talk about it in Chapter 12.\nSuppose \\((X_1, \\dots, X_n)\\) is the random sample from a population distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\), and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). Can we know the mean and variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean \\(\\overline{X} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i}{n}\\), denoted by \\(\\mu_{\\overline{X}}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{X}}\\) respectively? The answer is yes. In fact,\n\n \\(\\mu_{\\overline{X}} = \\mu\\) . The mean of \\(\\mu_{\\overline{X}}\\) is equal to the population mean \\(\\mu\\), i.e., \\(E(\\overline{X}) = \\mu\\).\n \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{X}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) . The standard deviation of \\(\\overline{X}\\) is not equal to the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). It is actually \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) that is smaller than \\(\\sigma\\). This is consistent with the property that \\(\\overline{X}\\) is less variable than an individual variable \\(X_i\\) we learned before. Notice that the variation of \\(\\overline{X}\\) is getting smaller as the sample size \\(n\\) get large. \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{X}}\\) is also known as the standard error of \\(\\overline{X}\\).\n\nIf the population distribution is  \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) , then the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\) is also normally distributed:  \\(N\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} \\right)\\) .\nFigure 11.3 depicts that the sampling distributions of the sample mean are less variable than the population distribution (black colored). As the sample size \\(n\\) increases from 2 (red), 4 (blue), to 8 (green), its corresponding sampling distribution is getting less variable, with smaller chance to have extreme values. Since the population distribution is normally distributed, so is the sampling distribution. The population distribution and the sampling distribution have the same mean, both centered at one.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: Comparison between sampling distributions and the population distribution.\n\n\n\n\n Example: Rolling a Die \nLet’s see how we get a sampling distribution through an example. Suppose one rolls a fair die 3 times 🎲🎲 🎲 independently to obtain 3 values from the “population” \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). Well if we let \\(X_i, i = 1, 2, 3\\) be the number showing up for the \\(i\\)th roll, then each \\(X_i\\) follows the discrete uniform distribution \\(P(X_i = 1) = P(X_i = 2) = \\cdots = P(X_i = 6) = 1/6\\) because \\(X_i\\) is a discrete random variable and a fair die is rolled. The population mean is \\((1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 3.5.\\) Figure 11.4 shows the population distribution.\nTo obtain the sampling distribution of the sample mean, we first repeat the process 10,000 times, and get 10,000 corresponding sample means.\n\n\n          x1 x2 x3     mean\nDataset-1  6  3  2 3.666667\nDataset-2  4  2  5 3.666667\nDataset-3  3  2  6 3.666667\n\n\n. . . . . .\n\n\n              x1 x2 x3     mean\nDataset-9998   5  4  6 5.000000\nDataset-9999   4  1  1 2.000000\nDataset-10000  4  6  1 3.666667\n\n\nThen plot the histogram of those sampling means. Figure 11.5 shows the histogram of those 10000 sample means which can be treated as the sampling distribution of the sample mean. What do we see from the plots? First, since the population distribution is discrete, so is the sampling distribution. Second, both have the identical mean 3.5. 1 Third, the sampling distribution look more like a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: Population distribution is discrete uniformly distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: Sampling distribution is more normal-like."

    "text": "11.3 Standardization of Sample Mean\nAny random variable can be standardized. For a single random variable \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), we have \\(Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\sim N(0, 1)\\). For the sample mean of \\(n\\) variables, we know \\(\\overline{X} \\sim N(\\mu_{\\overline{X}}, \\sigma^2_{\\overline{X}}) = N(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n})\\). To standardize \\(\\overline{X}\\), and make a new standard normal variable from it, we just subtract it from its own mean and divided by it own standard deviation:\n \\[Z = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_{\\overline{X}}}{\\sigma_{\\overline{X}}} = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} \\sim N(0, 1)\\]\nAgain, since \\(\\overline{X}\\) is a random variable, its transformation is also a random variable. \\(\\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\) is a standard normal variable.\n Example: Psychomotor Retardation \n\n\nSuppose psychomotor retardation scores for a group of patients have a normal distribution with a mean of 930 and a standard deviation of 130.\n\nWhat is the probability that the mean retardation score of a random sample of 20 patients was between 900 and 960?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, from the question assume that \\((X_1, \\dots, X_{20})\\) forms a random sample, and \\(X_1, \\dots, X_{20} \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N(930, 130^2)\\). Then \\(\\overline{X} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{20}X_i}{20} \\sim N\\left(930, \\frac{130^2}{20} \\right)\\).\nWhat we want to compute is \\(P(900 < \\overline{X} < 960)\\). We can first standardize \\(\\overline{X}\\) and represent the probability using standard normal \\(Z\\): \\[\\small \\begin{align}\nP(900 < \\overline{X} < 960) &= P\\left( \\frac{900-930}{130/\\sqrt{20}} < \\frac{\\overline{X}-930}{130/\\sqrt{20}} < \\frac{960-930}{130/\\sqrt{20}}\\right)=P(-1.03 < Z < 1.03)\\\\\n&=P(Z < 1.03) - P(Z < -1.03)\n  \\end{align}\\]\nFinally we just need to find \\(P(Z < 1.03)\\) and \\(P(Z < -1.03)\\) using R:\n\n(960-930)/(130/sqrt(20))\n\n[1] 1.032031\n\n(900-930)/(130/sqrt(20))\n\n[1] -1.032031\n\npnorm(1.032031) - pnorm(-1.032031)\n\n[1] 0.6979424\n\n\nIf we don’t do standardization, remember to use values in the original scale, and specify the mean and standard deviation. Keep in mind the standard deviation is \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{X}} = 130/\\sqrt{20}\\), not \\(130\\).\n\n## P(Xbar < 960) - P(Xbar < 900)\npnorm(960, mean = 930, sd = 130/sqrt(20)) - \n  pnorm(900, mean = 930, sd = 130/sqrt(20))\n\n[1] 0.6979426\n\n\nThe probability that the mean psychomotor retardation score of a random sample of 20 patients is between 900 and 960 is about 70%."

    "section": "\n12.2 Central Limit Theorem",
    "text": "12.2 Central Limit Theorem\nIt’s time to talk about the most important theorem in probability and statistics, at least in my opinion, the central limit theorem (CLT).\nIn sampling distribution Chapter 11, we learned that if \\(X_i \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), then \\(\\overline{X} \\sim N\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} \\right)\\). But the question is  what if the population distribution is NOT normal?  What does the sampling distribution of the sample mean look like if the population distribution is multimodal? or skewed? or not bell-shaped? Well, the central limit theorem gives us the answer!\n\n\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem (CLT):\nSuppose \\(\\overline{X}\\) is the sample mean from a random sample of size \\(n\\) and from a population distribution having mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma < \\infty\\). As \\(n\\) increases, the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\) looks more and more like \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2/n)\\) regardless of the distribution from which we are sampling!\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Illustration of Central Limit Theorem. Source: Wiki.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1 illustrates the CLT. First, the random sample \\((X_1, \\dots, X_n)\\) can be collected from any population distribution, whether it is normal or not. The magic part is that the sampling distribution of the sample mean \\(\\overline{X}\\) always looks like normal distribution \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2/n)\\) as long as the sample size \\(n\\) is sufficiently large. The larger \\(n\\) is, the more normal-like the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\) is. One question is how large is enough for \\(n\\). Amazingly the normal approximation is quite well when \\(n \\ge 30\\). The variance of the sampling distribution which is \\(\\sigma^2/n\\) is decreasing with \\(n\\) as well.\nPlease try the app and see how the shape of the sampling distribution changes with the sample size \\(n\\) and with the shape of the population distribution. You will find that it requires larger \\(n\\) to get a more normal-like sampling distribution if the population distribution is very skewed. You can also see how the CLT works in Figure 12.2 and Figure 12.3. The population distribution can be discrete, like binomial or Poisson distribution. Their sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\) will still look like normal although the sampling distribution is not continuous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: CLT Illustration: A Right-Skewed Distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: CLT Illustration: A U-shaped Distribution.\n\n\n\n\nIn sum, for a random sample \\((X_1, \\dots, X_n)\\), if the population distribution is normally distributed, then of course with no surprise the sampling distribution of the sample mean is also exactly normally distributed. If the population distribution is not normally distributed, as long as its mean and variance exist, its sampling distribution of the sample mean will still look like a normal distribution when the sample size \\(n\\) is large enough.\n\n\\(X_i \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim} N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). \\(\\overline{X} \\sim N\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} \\right)\\)\n\\(X_i \\stackrel{iid}{\\sim}\\) any distribution (\\(\\mu, \\sigma^2\\)). \\(\\overline{X}\\) looks like \\(N\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} \\right)\\) (for \\(n\\) sufficiently large)\n\nWhy is the central limit theorem Important? Many well-developed statistical methods are based on the normal distribution assumption. With the central limit theorem, we can use these methods even if we are sampling from a non-normal distribution or if we have no idea what the population distribution is, provided that the sample size is large enough."

    "text": "13.1 Point Estimator\nLet me ask you a question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you could only use a single number to guess the unknown population mean, \\(\\mu\\), what number would you like to use?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the single number you use can be computed from of sample data \\((X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)\\), then you use a point estimator to estimate the unknown parameter \\(\\mu\\). Previously we learned that a sample statistic is any transformation or function of \\((X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)\\). Therefore, any statistic is considered a point estimator if it is used to estimate a population parameter.\nA point estimate is a value of a point estimator used to estimate a population parameter. So here is the subtle difference. A point estimator is a random variable which is a function of sample data \\((X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)\\) (before actually being collected), and a point estimate is the realized value a point estimator, which is a value calculated from the collected data. For example, \\(\\overline{X} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\\) is a point estimator, and with the sample data \\((x_1, x_2, x_3) = (2, 3, 7)\\), the point estimate is \\(\\overline{x} = \\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{i=1}^3x_i = \\frac{1}{3}(2+3+7) = 4.\\)\nBack to the question. If we want to estimate the unknown population mean, which number we use to estimate it? We now have an intuitive answer. The sample mean \\(\\overline{X}\\) is a statistic and a point estimator for the population mean \\(\\mu\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sample Mean as an Point Estimator \nLet’s see how the sample mean is used as an point estimator for \\(\\mu.\\) Suppose the true population distribution is \\(N(2, 1)\\). Here the population mean \\(\\mu\\) is two, but let’s pretend we don’t know its value and see how the sample mean performs. Such analysis is called simulation study.\nWe are going to collect a sample of size five, \\((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)\\). In the simulation, we draw five values from \\(N(2, 1)\\). The five drawn values are treated as our sample data, and \\(N(2, 1)\\) is the population distribution. In R, we use rnorm() to generate random numbers from a normal distribution, where the first argument is the number of observations to be generated.\n\n## Generate data x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, each from distribution N(2, 1)\nset.seed(1234)\nx_data_1 <- rnorm(n = 5, mean = 2, sd = 1)\n\nThe following shows the realized five data points and the sample mean.\n\n\n\n\nx1\nx2\nx3\nx4\nx5\nsample mean\n\n\n0.79\n2.28\n3.08\n-0.35\n2.43\n1.65\n\n\n\n\nHere we use the sample mean \\(\\overline{X} = \\frac{1}{5}\\sum_{i=1}^5X_i\\) as our point estimator for \\(\\mu\\), and given the sample, the point estimate is \\(\\overline{x}=\\) 1.65. You can see that the true \\(\\mu\\) is two, but the point estimate \\(\\overline{x}\\) is not equal to \\(\\mu\\). Why?\nAs we discussed in Chapter 11, due to the randomness nature of drawing a sample value from the population distribution, we do not expect the statistic to be the same as the corresponding parameter. It is possible that most of our sample values happen to be larger or smaller than the true mean, or we may unluckily get an outlier sample value that distorts and drags the sample value toward it. In such cases, the sample mean will be not close to the true population mean. You can think this way. One data point represents one piece of information about the unknown population distribution. With a small sample size, our sample only represents a small part of the unknown distribution. The gap between sample mean and the true population mean is kind of like information lost because of not being able to collect the rest of the subjects in the population.\nFigure 13.1 shows the sample data and the population distribution \\(N(2, 1)\\). Notice that we have an extreme value \\(-0.35\\) that is two standard deviations below the mean, and this causes the sample mean to be small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: Population distribution and sample data.\n\n\n\n\nWell, we could collect a sample again if resources are permitted. In simulation, another sample of size five is drawn from the same population \\(N(2, 1)\\), and the result is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx1\nx2\nx3\nx4\nx5\nsample mean\n\n\n2.59\n2.71\n1.89\n1.55\n2.61\n2.27\n\n\n\n\nThe second sample mean, \\(\\overline{x} =\\) 2.27, is different from the first one. Why do the first sample and the second sample give us different sample means? Now you see why we want to learn sampling distribution. We use sample mean as the point estimator for \\(\\mu\\), and the sample mean has its own sampling distribution. Therefore, the sample mean varies from sample to sample due to its randomness nature.\n\n\n\n\nWe have connected sampling distribution to statistical inference, in particular the point estimation together. Figure 13.2 shows the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\) which is \\(N(2, 1/5)\\) and the two sample mean values calculated from the two data sets. Now can you see why we want to use \\(\\overline{X}\\) as the point estimator for \\(\\mu\\)? It is because the expected value of \\(\\overline{X}\\), \\(E(\\overline{X})\\) is exactly equal to \\(\\mu\\), meaning that if we were able to produces a lot of \\(\\overline{x}\\)s, the average of these \\(\\overline{x}\\)s will be very close to the true unknown \\(\\mu\\) although single one \\(\\overline{x}\\) may still be distant from \\(\\mu\\). When the expected value of a point estimator is equal to the parameter it estimates, we say it is an unbiased estimator. Therefore, the sample mean \\(\\overline{X}\\) is an unbiased estimator for the population mean \\(\\mu\\) because \\(E(\\overline{X}) = \\mu\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: Sampling Distribution of Sampling Mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why Point Estimates Are Not Enough \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to estimate \\(\\mu\\), would you prefer to report a range of values the parameter might be in or a single estimate like \\(\\overline{x}\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince \\(\\overline{X}\\) is random and has its own distribution, its value varies from sample to sample. However, in reality we usually have only one data set, and one realized sample mean, and we are not able to replicate other data sets due to limited resources. We don’t know the sample mean we got is close to the true unknown population mean or not. First, the sample mean can go anywhere of its distribution, and the one we got may be far away from \\(\\mu\\). Moreover, we don’t know the value of \\(\\mu\\)! It does not make much sense to use just one single number when those uncertainty are there.\nIf you want to catch a fish, would you prefer to use a spear or a net? I would use a net because I’m not a sharpshooter, and using a net covers a large range of possible locations where the fish can be. Due to the variation of \\(\\overline{X}\\), if we report a point estimate, we probably won’t hit the exact population parameter. If we report a range of plausible values, we have a good shot at capturing the parameter."

    "section": "\n13.2 Confidence Intervals",
    "text": "13.2 Confidence Intervals\nIn statistics, a plausible range of values for \\(\\mu\\) is called a confidence interval (CI). This range depends on how precise and reliable our statistic is as an estimate of the parameter. To construct a CI for \\(\\mu\\), we first need to quantify the variability of our sample mean. Quantifying this uncertainty requires a measurement of how much we would expect the sample statistic to vary from sample to sample. This is in fact the variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean! Intuitively speaking, if \\(\\overline{x}\\) varies a lot, we are more uncertain about whether the \\(\\overline{x}\\) we got is close to the \\(\\mu\\) or not. In other words, the precision of the estimation is not that good. In order to make sure that the plausible range of values does capture \\(\\mu\\), we need to include more possible values, and make the range larger. Do we know the variance of \\(\\overline{X}\\)? Absolutely. Thanks to CLT, \\(\\overline{X} \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2/n)\\) regardless of what the population distribution is.\nHow confident we are about the CI covering the parameter is called the level of confidence. The higher the confidence level is, the more reliable the CI is because the CI is more likely to capture the parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGiven the same level of confidence, the larger the variation of \\(\\overline{X}\\) is, the wider the CI for \\(\\mu\\) will be.\n\n\n\n Precision vs. Reliability \nWith a fixed sample size, the precision and reliability of a confidence interval are trading off. Here is a question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to be very certain that we capture \\(\\mu\\), should we use a wider or a narrower interval? What drawbacks are associated with using a wider interval?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use a wider interval because a wider interval is more likely to capture the population parameter value. So a more reliable confidence interval is wider than a less reliable confidence interval. But What drawbacks are associated with using a wider interval?\nThe precision and reliability trade-off is clearly explained in the cute comic in Figure 13.3. I can say I am 100% confident that your exam 1 score is between 0 and 100. Am I right? Yes. But do I provide helpful information? Absolutely not, the interval includes every possible score of the exam. The interval is too wide to be helpful. Such interval is 100% reliable but with no precision at all.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.3: Balance between precision and reliability. Source: https://thestatsninja.com/2019/02/19/how-to-navigate-confidence-intervals-with-confidence/\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower intervals are more precise but less reliable, while wider intervals are more reliable but less precise. How can we get best of both worlds – high precision and high reliability/accuracy, meaning short interval with high level of confidence? What we need is larger sample size, given that the sample quality is good. It is a quite easy statement, but sometimes it’s hard to collect more samples.\n\n A Confidence Interval Is for a Parameter \nA confidence interval is for a parameter, NOT a statistic. Remember, a confidence interval is a way of doing estimation for a unknown parameter. For example, we use the sample mean to form a confidence interval for the population mean.\nWe NEVER say “The confidence interval of the sample mean, \\(\\overline{X}\\), is ….” We SAY “The confidence interval for the true population mean \\(\\mu\\), is …”\nIn general, a confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) has the form\n\n\\(\\large \\overline{x} \\pm m = (\\overline{x} - m, \\overline{x} + m)\\)\n\nThe \\(m\\) is called the margin of error. It controls the width of the interval \\(2m\\). The CI is centered at the sample mean, and \\(\\overline{x} - m\\) is the lower bound and \\(\\overline{x} + m\\) is the upper bound of the confidence interval. The point estimate, \\(\\overline{x}\\), and margin of error, \\(m\\), can be obtained from known quantities and our data once sampled.\n\n \\((1 - \\alpha)100\\%\\) Confidence Intervals \nFormally, for \\(0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1\\), we define the confidence level \\(1-\\alpha\\) as the proportion of times that the CI contains the population parameter, assuming that the estimation process is repeated a large number of times.\nThe confidence level can be any number between zero and one. Common choices for the confidence level include 90% \\((\\alpha = 0.10)\\), 95% \\((\\alpha = 0.05)\\) and 99% \\((\\alpha = 0.01)\\). Keep in mind that confidence level tells us the reliability of the interval. Because precision and reliability have a trade-off relationship, a CI with very high confidence level (high reliability) will have less precision, i.e., larger margin of error and with width of the interval. 95% is the most common level because it has a good balance between precision (width of the CI) and reliability (confidence level).\n\n\n High reliability and Low precision: I am 100% confident that the mean height of Marquette students is between 3’0” and 8’0”. \n\nDuh…🤷\n\n\n\n Low reliability and High precision: I am 20% confident that mean height of Marquette students is between 5’6” and 5’7”. \n\nThis is far from the truth… 🙅\n\n\n\n\n \\(95\\%\\) Confidence Intervals for \\(\\mu\\) \nWe’ve learned the general form of a confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) and defined the confidence level. We now formally derive the form of the \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\). For simplicity, here we assume \\(\\sigma\\) is known to us when the interval is constructed. A confidence interval can be derived from the sampling distribution of the point estimator. Such approach is called the distribution-based approach. A confidence interval can also be derived using simulation, and such approach is called simulation-based approach, bootstraping method for example. This chapter we build a CI based on the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\). We discuss bootstraping in Chapter 14.\n\nSuppose we want to obtain the \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\). So \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). We start with the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X} \\sim N\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right)\\) shown in Figure 13.4. The sampling distribution tells us that the realized value \\(\\overline{x}\\) will be within 1.96 SDs of the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), \\(95\\%\\) of the time. In other words,\n\\[P\\left(\\mu-1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} < \\overline{X} < \\mu + 1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) = 0.95\\]\nHere the \\(z\\)-score of 1.96 is the 97.5% percentile of the standard normal distribution and -1.96 is the 2.5% percentile. The \\(z\\)-score 1.96 is associated with 2.5% area to the right and is called a critical value denoted as \\(z_{0.025} = z_{\\alpha/2}\\) . The \\(z\\)-score -1.96 is associated with 2.5% area to the left, and it happens to be the negative value of \\(z_{0.025}\\) because of the symmetry of normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.4: Sampling distribution of the sample mean with 95% probability in the middle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe learned that \\[P\\left(\\mu-1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} < \\overline{X} < \\mu + 1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) = 0.95.\\] The probability that the variable \\(\\overline{X}\\) is in the interval \\(\\left(\\mu-1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\mu+1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)\\) is 95%. But is the interval \\(\\left(\\mu-1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\mu+1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)\\) our confidence interval?\nThe answer is No ❌!

    "text": "13.3 Confidence Intervals for \\(\\mu\\) When \\(\\sigma\\) is Known\nWe just obtained the 95% confident interval for \\(\\mu\\). How about the general \\((1-\\alpha)100%\\) confident interval for \\(\\mu\\) (when \\(\\sigma\\) is known)? We first introduce the requirements for constructing the interval, then provide the interval formula.\nThe requirements for estimating \\(\\mu\\) when \\(\\sigma\\) is known include\n\n👉 The sample should be a random sample, such that all data \\(X_i\\) are drawn from the same population and \\(X_i\\) and \\(X_j\\) are independent. In fact,  any methods in this course are based on the assumption of a random sample \n\n👉 The population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\), is known.\n👉 The population is either normally distributed, \\(n > 30\\) or both, i.e., \\(X_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\).  The sample size \\(n > 30\\) allows the central limit theorem to be applied and hence normality is satisfied. \n\n\nThe general \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) can be borrowed from the \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\left(\\overline{x}-z_{0.025}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\overline{x} + z_{0.025}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\). The 95% confidence level means \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). For the general \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) confidence interval, we just replace \\(z_{0.025}\\) with \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) for any \\(\\alpha\\) between zero and one.

Assume that the population distribution is normal and has a standard deviation of 5 mmHg. We have a random sample of 16 subjects from this population with a mean of 121.5 mmHg. Estimate the mean SBP with a 95% confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe construct the confidence interval step by step using the procedure.\n\nRequirements:\n\n Normality is assumed, \\(\\sigma = 5\\) is known and a random sample is collected.\n\n\nDecide \\(\\alpha\\):\n\n \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) \n\n\nFind the critical value \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\):\n\n \\(z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} = 1.96\\) \n\n\nEvaluate margin of error \\(m = z_{\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\):\n\n \\(m = (1.96) \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{16}} = 2.45\\) \n\n\nConstruct the \\((1 - \\alpha)100\\%\\) CI:\n\n The 95% CI for the mean SBP is \\(\\overline{x} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = (121.5 -2.45, 121.5 + 2.45) = (119.05, 123.95)\\) \n\n\n\nBelow is a demonstration of how to find the 95% CI for SBP using R.\n\n## save all information we have\nalpha <- 0.05\nn <- 16\nx_bar <- 121.5\nsig <- 5\n\n## 95% CI\n## z-critical value\n(cri_z <- qnorm(p = alpha / 2, lower.tail = FALSE))  \n\n[1] 1.959964\n\n## margin of error\n(m_z <- cri_z * (sig / sqrt(n)))  \n\n[1] 2.449955\n\n## 95% CI for mu when sigma is known\nx_bar + c(-1, 1) * m_z  \n\n[1] 119.05 123.95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruct a 99% CI for the mean SBP. Do you expect it to have a wider or narrower interval than the 95% CI? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Interpreting the Confidence Interval\nWe have known how to construct a confidence interval. But what on earth is that? How do we interpret the interval correctly? This is pretty important because the interval is usually misinterpreted and inappropriately used in statistical analysis. Don’t blame yourself if you find it hard to understand the meaning. The confidence interval concept is not intuitive, and it does not really answer what we care about the unknown parameter. The confidence interval is a concept in the classical or frequestist point of view. Another way of interval estimation is to use the so called credible interval that uses Bayesian philosophy. We will discuss their difference in detail in Chapter 20.\nBack to a 95% confidence interval. The following statements and interpretations are wrong. Please do not interpret the interval this way.\n\nWRONG ❌ “There is a 95% chance/probability that the true population mean will fall between 119.1 mm and 123.9 mm.”\nWRONG ❌ “The probability that the true population mean falls between 119.1 mm and 123.9 mm is 95%.”\n\nAlthough those statements are often what we want, they are completely wrong. Let’s learn why. The sample mean is a random variable with a sampling distribution, so it makes sense to compute a probability of it being in some interval. The population mean is unknown and FIXED, so we cannot assign or compute any probability of it. If we were using Bayesian inference Chapter 20, a different inference method, we could compute a probability associated with \\(\\mu\\) because in Bayesian statistics \\(\\mu\\) is treated as a random variable.\nSo how do we correctly interpret a confidence interval? Here is the answer.\n “We are 95% confident that the mean SBP lies between 119.1 mm and 123.9 mm.” \nBut still what does “95% confident” really mean? This means if we were able to collect our data many times and build the corresponding CIs, we would expect that about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter, which, in this case, is the mean systolic blood pressure.\nRemember that \\(\\overline{x}\\) varies from sample to sample, so does its corresponding CI because the CI is a function of \\(\\overline{X}\\) given \\(n\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). This idea is shown in Figure 13.5. Here we do a simulation assuming \\(\\mu\\) is known at 120, and \\(\\sigma = 5\\). Also, assume we were able to repeatedly collect our sample of the same size \\(n = 16\\). Here 100 data sets are generated, and for each data set, the sample mean and its corresponding 95% CI are computed. Since the confidence level is 95%, 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter, 120 in this example. The 36th, 45th, 52nd, 82nd, and 99th data sets have the interval not capturing the true parameter.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.5: Illustration of 100 95% confidence intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPlease keep the following ideas in mind.\n\nA 95% CI does not mean that if 100 data sets are collected, there will be exactly 95 intervals capturing \\(\\mu\\). It is a long-term sampling idea.\nWe never know with certainty that 95% of the intervals, or any single interval for that matter, contains the true population parameter because again we never know what the true value of the parameter is.\nIn reality, we usually have only one data set, and we are not able to collect more data. We have no idea of whether our 95% confidence interval capture the unknown parameter or not. We are only “95% confident”.\n\n\n\nThe procedure of generating 100 confidence intervals for \\(\\mu\\) when \\(\\sigma\\) is known is shown in the algorithm below.\n\n\nAlgorithm\nSimulation Result\nCode\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm\n\nGenerate 100 sampled data of size \\(n\\): \\((x_1^1, x_2^1, \\dots, x_n^1), \\dots (x_1^{100}, x_2^{100}, \\dots, x_n^{100})\\), where \\(x_i^m \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\).\nObtain 100 sample means \\((\\overline{x}^1, \\dots, \\overline{x}^{100})\\).\nFor each \\(m = 1, 2, \\dots, 100\\), compute the corresponding confidence interval \\[\\left(\\overline{x}^m - z_{\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\overline{x}^m + z_{\\alpha/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmu <- 120; sig <- 5 \nal <- 0.05; M <- 100; n <- 16\n\nset.seed(2023)\nx_rep <- replicate(M, rnorm(n, mu, sig))\nxbar_rep <- apply(x_rep, 2, mean)\nE <- qnorm(p = 1 - al / 2) * sig / sqrt(n)\nci_lwr <- xbar_rep - E\nci_upr <- xbar_rep + E\n\nplot(NULL, xlim = range(c(ci_lwr, ci_upr)), ylim = c(0, 100), \n     xlab = \"95% CI\", ylab = \"Sample\", las = 1)\nmu_out <- (mu < ci_lwr | mu > ci_upr)\nsegments(x0 = ci_lwr, y0 = 1:M, x1 = ci_upr, col = \"navy\", lwd = 2)\nsegments(x0 = ci_lwr[mu_out], y0 = (1:M)[mu_out], x1 = ci_upr[mu_out], \n         col = 2, lwd = 2)\nabline(v = mu, col = \"#FFCC00\", lwd = 2)"

    "text": "13.4 Confidence Intervals for \\(\\mu\\) When \\(\\sigma\\) is Unknown\nWe complete the discussion of confidence intervals for \\(\\mu\\) when \\(\\sigma\\) is known. Do you see anything unreasonable? Do you think that assuming \\(\\sigma^2\\) is known is reasonable? In fact, the population variance is calculated as \\(\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \\mu)^2}{N}\\), where \\(N\\) is the population size. The formula involves \\(\\mu\\), the unknown parameter we’d like to estimate. It’s rare that we don’t know \\(\\mu\\) but know \\(\\sigma\\). What do we do if \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown?\nWhen \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown to us, we cannot use normal distribution anymore. Instead, we use the Student’s t distribution (or \\(t\\)-distribution) to construct a confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) when \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown. To construct these confidence intervals we still need\n\nA random sample\nA population that is normally distributed and/or \\(n > 30\\).\n\nThe confidence interval when \\(\\sigma\\) is known includes \\(\\sigma\\) in the formula. When \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown, we cannot use the formula and need to find \\(\\sigma\\)’s surrogate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a natural estimator for the unknown \\(\\sigma\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown, we use the sample standard deviation, \\(S = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \\overline{X})^2}{n-1}}\\), instead when constructing the CI.\n\n Student’s t Distribution \nIf the population is normally distributed or \\(n > 30\\), we know \\(\\overline{X}\\) is exactly or approximately \\(N\\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} \\right)\\). Therefore \\(Z = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu}{\\color{red}\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} \\sim N(0, 1)\\). Now if \\(\\sigma\\) is replaced with its surrogate \\(S\\), then the new random variable say \\(T\\) will be student’s t distributed with the degrees of freedom (df) \\(n-1\\):\n \\[T = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu}{\\color{red}S/\\sqrt{n}} \\sim t_{n-1}\\]  \nHere the degrees of freedom is the parameter of the student’s t distribution.\n Properties \nThe student’s t distribution, as shown in Figure 13.6, looks pretty similar to the standard normal distribution, but they are different. Some of the properties of the student’s t distribution are listed below.\n\nFor any degrees of freedom, the student’s t distribution is symmetric about the mean 0 and bell-shaped like \\(N(0, 1)\\).\nFor any degrees of freedom, the student’s t distribution has more variability than \\(N(0, 1)\\), meaning that the distribution has heavier tails and lower peak.\nThe the student’s t distribution has less variability for larger degrees of freedom (sample size).\nAs \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\) \\((df \\rightarrow \\infty)\\), the student’s t distribution approaches \\(N(0, 1)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.6: Student t distributions with various degrees of freedom.\n\n\n\n\n Critical Values of \\(t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}\\) \nIn the CI formula with known \\(\\sigma\\), we use the critical value \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\), the standard normal value so that \\(P(Z > z_{\\alpha/2}) = \\alpha/2\\). When \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown, we use \\(t_{\\alpha/2, n - 1}\\) as the critical value, instead of \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\). Notice that the standard normal has nothing to do with \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) of a general \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) distribution. 1 Therefore no parameter is attached to \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\). However, the \\(t\\) critical value \\(t_{\\alpha/2, n - 1}\\) changes with the degrees of freedom \\(n - 1\\). With the same logic, the critical value \\(t_{\\alpha/2, n - 1}\\) is a Student’s t value with degrees of freedom \\(n - 1\\) so that \\(P(T_{n-1} > t_{\\alpha/2, n - 1}) = \\alpha/2\\) as shown in Figure 13.7.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.7: Illustration of critical value for Student t distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the same \\(\\alpha\\), is \\(t_{\\alpha, n-1}\\) or \\(z_{\\alpha}\\) larger?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should be able to answer this question based on the fact that for any degrees of freedom, the student’s t distribution has more variability than \\(N(0, 1)\\), or heavier tails. The heavier tail forces \\(t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}\\) to be more extreme than \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\). Figure 13.8 illustrates this fact. The red \\(t_{df = 2}\\) distribution has heavier tails than the black standard normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.8: z and t critical values.\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows \\(z\\) and \\(t\\) critical values at confidence level 90%, 95% and 99%. The \\(t\\) values are getting closer to the \\(z\\) values as the degree of freedom increases. When the degree of freedom goes to infinity, the \\(t\\) values converge to \\(z\\) values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nt df = 5\nt df = 15\nt df = 30\nt df = 1000\nt df = inf\nz\n\n\n\n90%\n2.02\n1.75\n1.70\n1.65\n1.64\n1.64\n\n\n95%\n2.57\n2.13\n2.04\n1.96\n1.96\n1.96\n\n\n99%\n4.03\n2.95\n2.75\n2.58\n2.58\n2.58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) Confidence Intervals for \\(\\mu\\) When \\(\\sigma\\) is Unknown \nWe have been equipped with everything we need for constructing \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) when \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown. The interval is  \\[\\left(\\overline{x} - t_{\\alpha/2, n-1} \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\overline{x} + t_{\\alpha/2, n-1} \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\] \nThe interval form is the same as before. We have the sample mean plus and minus the margin of error. Comparing to the interval with known \\(\\sigma\\), the difference is that \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) is replaced with \\(t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}\\), and \\(\\sigma\\) is replaced with \\(s\\).\nGiven the same confidence level \\(1-\\alpha\\), \\(t_{\\alpha/2, n-1} > z_{\\alpha/2}\\), leading to a wider interval if \\(s\\) is not too smaller than the true \\(\\sigma\\). The intuition is that we are more uncertain when doing inference about \\(\\mu\\) because we don’t have information about both \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\), and replacing \\(\\sigma\\) with \\(s\\) adds additional uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n Computation in R \nBack to the systolic blood pressure (SBP) example. We have \\(n=16\\) and \\(\\overline{x} = 121.5\\). Estimate the mean SBP with a 95% confidence interval with unknown \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(s = 5\\). The code for the \\(t\\) interval is pretty similar to the \\(z\\) interval. The main difference is that we are gonna use qt() to find a quantile or critical value from the Student’s t distribution. In the function, the first argument is still the given probability, then we must specify the degrees of freedom, otherwise R cannot determine which \\(t\\)-distribution is being considered, and will render an error message.\n\nalpha <- 0.05\nn <- 16\nx_bar <- 121.5\ns <- 5  ## sigma is unknown and s = 5\n\n## t-critical value\n(cri_t <- qt(p = alpha / 2, df = n - 1, lower.tail = FALSE)) \n\n[1] 2.13145\n\n## margin of error\n(m_t <- cri_t * (s / sqrt(n)))  \n\n[1] 2.664312\n\n## 95% CI for mu when sigma is unknown\nx_bar + c(-1, 1) * m_t  \n\n[1] 118.8357 124.1643\n\n\n\\(z_{0.025} = 1.96 < t_{0.025, 15} = 2.13\\).

    "section": "\n15.1 Introduction",
    "text": "15.1 Introduction\n What is Hypothesis Testing? \nIn statistics, a hypothesis is a claim or statement about a property of a population, often the value of a population distribution parameter. For example,\n\n The mean body temperature of humans is less than \\(98.6^{\\circ}\\) F.  Here the mean body temperature is a property or characteristic of target population human beings. We can turn the verbal claim into a brief mathematical expression \\(\\mu < 98.6\\).\n Marquette students’ IQ scores has standard deviation equal to 15.  The IQ score standard deviation is a characteristic of the population Marquette students. Mathematically, we can write the claim as \\(\\sigma = 15\\).\n\nYou can see that we usually focus on claims about a population distribution parameter. \nThe null hypothesis, denoted \\(H_0\\), is a statement that the value of a parameter is equal to some claim value, or the negation of the alternative hypothesis that will be discussed in a minute. Often \\(H_0\\) represents a skeptical perspective or a claim to be tested, or the current status of the parameter. For example, the claim “the percentage of Marquette female students loving Japanese food is equal to 80%” is a \\(H_0\\) claim because of the key word “equal”. Usually we are not very convinced that the \\(H_0\\) claim is true, and in our analysis we want to test the claim, and see whether the evidence and information we collect is strong enough to make a conclusion that the percentage is not equal to 80%.\nThe alternative hypothesis, denoted \\(H_1\\) or \\(H_a\\), is a claim that the parameter is less than, greater than or not equal to some value. It is usually our research hypothesis of some new scientific theory or finding. If we think the percentage of Marquette female students loving Japanese food is greater than 80%, this hypothesis is the \\(H_1\\) claim. If after a formal testing procedure, we conclude that the percentage is greater than 80%, we sort of make a new research discovery that overturns the previous claim or status quo that the percentage is equal to 80%.\nLet’s do one more exercise. Is the statement “On average, Marquette students consume less than 3 drinks per week.” a \\(H_0\\) or \\(H_1\\) claim? Because of the key word “less than”, it is a \\(H_1\\) claim.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what is hypothesis testing? Hypothesis testing 1 is a procedure to decide whether or not to reject \\(H_0\\) based on how much evidence there is against \\(H_0\\). If the evidence is strong enough, we reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_1\\).\n\n Example \nBefore we jump into the formal hypothesis testing procedure, let’s talk about a criminal charge example. How a criminal is convicted is similar to the formal testing procedure.\n\n\nSuppose a person is charged with a crime, and a jury will decide whether the person is guilty or not. We all know the rule: Even though the person is charged with the crime, at the beginning of the trial, the accuse is assumed to be innocent until the jury declares otherwise. Only if overwhelming evidence of the person’s guilt can be shown is the jury expected to declare the person guilty, otherwise the person is considered not guilty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to make a claim about whether the person is guilty or not, what are our \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\)? Remember that the null hypothesis represents a skeptical perspective or a claim to be tested, or the current status of the parameter, so we have\n\n\n\\(H_0:\\) The person is  not guilty  🙂\n\nThis is how we write a hypothesis: start with \\(H_0:\\) followed by the statement. Being not guilty is the default status quo of anyone, although the jury may doubt or be skeptical of the person being not guilty. The prosecutors and police detectives are trying their best the collect enough strong evidence to proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the jury. Therefore the alternative hypothesis is\n\n\n\\(H_1:\\) The person is  guilty  😟\n\nIn the example, the evidence could be  photos, videos, witnesses, fingerprints, DNA, and so on . How do we decide to keep \\(H_0\\) or to accept \\(H_1\\)? After all evidence including defense attorney and prosecutor’s arguments are presented to the jury, the decision rule is the  jury’s voting . Finally, to close the case, we need a conclusion that is the verdict  “guilty”  or  “Not enough evidence to convict” .\nPlease go through the entire criminal charge process again:\n\\(H_0\\) and \\(H_a\\) => Evidence => Decision rule => Conclusion\nThe process is quite similar to the formal procedure for a hypothesis testing."

    "text": "15.2 How to Formally Do a Statistical Hypothesis Testing\nThe entire hypothesis testing can be wrapped up in the following six steps. No worries if you don’t have any idea of it. We will learn this step by step using a test for the population mean \\(\\mu\\).\n\nStep 0: Check Method Assumptions\nStep 1: Set the \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_a\\) in Symbolic Form from a Claim\nStep 2: Set the Significance Level \\(\\alpha\\)\nStep 3: Calculate the Test Statistic (Evidence)\n\n\n\nDecision Rule I: Critical Value Method\n\n Step 4-c: Find the Critical Value \n Step 5-c: Draw a Conclusion Using Critical Value Method \n\n\nDecision Rule II: P-Value Method\n\n Step 4-p: Find the P-Value \n Step 5-p: Draw a Conclusion Using P-Value Method \n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Restate the Conclusion in Nontechnical Terms, and Address the Original Claim\n\nLet’s look at this example: Is the New Treatment Effective?\n\n\nA population of patients with hypertension is normal and has mean blood pressure (BP) of 150. After 6 months of treatment, the BP of 25 patients from this population was recorded. The sample mean BP is \\(\\overline{x} = 147.2\\) and the sample standard deviation is \\(s = 5.5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://unsplash.com/photos/i1iqQRLULlg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur goal is to determine whether a new treatment is effective in reducing BP. Let’s learn the testing procedure step by step using this example.\n\n\n Step 0: Check Method Assumptions \nAny statistical method is based on some assumptions. To use the method, and analyze our data appropriately, we have to make sure that the assumptions are satisfied. In this book, most of the distribution-based methods require\n\nRandom sample\nThe population is normally distributed and/or the sample size \\(n > 30\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.pinterest.ph/pin/633387417082544/\n\n\n\n\n\n Example Step 0: Check Method Assumptions \n\nFrom the question description,  A population of hypertension group is normal .\n\n\n Step 1: Set the \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) from a Claim \nThe first step of testing is to understand the \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) claims, and express them using mathematically using population parameters. The followings provdie three examples.\n\n🧑‍🏫 The mean IQ score of statistics professors is higher than 120.\n\n \\(\\begin{align}&H_0: \\mu \\le 120 \\\\ &H_1: \\mu > 120 \\end{align}\\) \n\n\n💵 The mean starting salary for Marquette graduates who didn’t take MATH 4720 is less than $60,000.\n\n \\(\\begin{align} &H_0: \\mu \\ge 60000 \\\\ &H_1: \\mu < 60000 \\end{align}\\) \n\n\n📺 The mean time between uses of a TV remote control by males during commercials equals 5 sec. \n\n \\(\\begin{align} &H_0: \\mu = 5 \\\\ &H_1: \\mu \\ne 5 \\end{align}\\) \n\n\n\nKeep in mind that the equality sign is always put in \\(H_0\\), and \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) are mutually exclusive. Also, the claims are for population parameters, not sample statistics. We are not sure the value of the parameter being tested, but we want to collect evidence, and see which claim about the parameter is supported by the evidence.\n Example Step 1: Set the \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) from a Claim \nThe claim that the new treatment is effective in reducing BP means the mean BP is less than 150, which is an \\(H_1\\) claim. So we can write our \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) as\n \\(\\small \\begin{align} &H_0: \\mu = 150 \\\\ &H_1: \\mu < 150 \\end{align}\\) \nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the mean blood pressure.\n\n Step 2: Set the Significance Level \\(\\alpha\\) \nNext, we set the significance level \\(\\alpha\\) that determines how rare or unlikely our evidence must be in order to represent sufficient evidence against \\(H_0\\). It tells us how strong the collected evidence must be in order to overturn the current claim. An \\(\\alpha\\) level of 0.05 implies that evidence occurring with probability lower than 5% will be considered sufficient evidence to reject \\(H_0\\). Mathematically, \\[\\alpha = P(\\text{Reject } H_0 \\mid H_0 \\text{ is true})\\] As a result, \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) means that we incorrectly reject \\(H_0\\) 5 out of every 100 times we collect a sample and run the test.\nHere is the idea. When we want to see if what we care about (the population parameter) is not as described as in the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\), we first assume or believe \\(H_0\\) is right, then based on this, we see if there is sufficient and strong evidence to conclude that it is probably not the case, and find the alternative hypothesis more reasonable.\nLet’s explain \\(\\alpha\\) by an example. Suppose we would like to test the claim that “The mean IQ of statistics professors is greater than 120.” Or in short \\(H_0: \\mu = 120\\) vs. \\(H_1: \\mu > 120\\). With large sample size, we can assume \\(\\overline{X}\\) follows a normal distribution. Now, to test whether the mean IQ is greater than 120, we need to first treat the mean not being greater than 120 unless later we have sufficient evidence to say it is greater than 120. In particular, we need to do the test and analysis on the basis that the mean is under \\(H_0\\). That is, we first assume the mean is 120, or \\(\\mu = 120\\), then see if the assumption really makes sense.\nBecause \\(\\overline{X}\\) is normal, we do the test under the assumption that \\(\\overline{X} \\sim N(120, \\sigma^2)\\) for some \\(\\sigma^2\\), say \\(9\\). (Let’s focus on \\(\\mu\\) and ignore \\(\\sigma\\) at this moment). If \\(\\overline{X}\\) has mean 120, and from our sample data we got the sample mean \\(\\overline{x} = 121\\), do you think the claim \\(H_0: \\mu = 120\\) make sense? How about you got \\(\\overline{x} = 127\\)? Now \\(\\alpha\\) comes into play. Let me ask you a question. What is the threshold or value of the sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) that you think it is too large to believe that \\(H_0: \\mu = 120\\) is a reasonable assumption or data generating mechanism? What is the threshold that makes you start to believe that \\(H_1: \\mu > 120\\) makes more sense than \\(H_0: \\mu = 120\\)? The significance level \\(\\alpha\\) is such threshold value. With \\(\\alpha\\) being specified, we know what is the corresponding sample mean threshold \\(\\overline{x}^*\\), which is the one such that \\(P(\\overline{X} > \\overline{x}^*) = \\alpha\\).\nFigure 15.1 illustrates the significance level \\(\\alpha\\). Once we decide \\(\\alpha\\), we determines how rare or unlikely our sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) must be in order to represent sufficient evidence against \\(H_0: \\mu = 120\\). In this example, if our \\(\\overline{x}\\) is greater than 125, we would think the evidence is strong enough to conclude that \\(\\mu = 120\\) is not so reasonable because the chance of such value happening is no larger than \\(\\alpha\\). We instead think \\(H_1: \\mu > 120\\) makes more sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: Illustration of significance level, alpha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entire rationale is the rare event rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRare Event Rule\n\n\n\nIf, under a given assumption, the probability of a particular observed event is exceptionally small, we conclude that the assumption is probably not correct.\n\n\n\n\nThe level \\(\\alpha\\) is related to the \\(\\alpha\\) used in confidence intervals for defining a “critical value”.\n Example Step 2: Set the Significance Level \\(\\alpha\\) \nThere is no \\(\\alpha\\) mentioned in the question description. Usually \\(\\alpha\\) is set by researchers themselves. Let’s set \\(\\alpha= 0.05\\). This means we are asking, “Is there a sufficient evidence at \\(\\alpha= 0.05\\) that the new treatment is effective?”\n\n Step 3: Calculate the Test Statistic \nSetting \\(\\alpha\\) is kind of setting the threshold for determining whether our collected evidence is sufficient or strong enough or not. In this step, we are collecting our evidence. The evidence is collected from the information we have, which is the sample data. Sample data is the only source we have for the inference about the unknown parameter. So to do a test about the parameter, or decide whether a statement about the parameter makes sense, we let the data and evidence speak up.\nThe evidence used in the hypothesis testing is called test statistic: a sample statistic value used in making a decision about the \\(H_0\\). Suppose  the test we are interested is \\(H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0\\) and \\(\\quad H_1: \\mu < \\mu_0\\)  where \\(\\mu_0\\) is some population mean value that could be 150 lbs, 175 cm, 50 ounces, etc. When computing a test statistic, we assume \\(H_0\\) is true. Remember, we are trying to see if there is any strong evidence that is against \\(H_0\\). We should do our analysis in the world of \\(H_0\\) or the status quo. If the evidence is not sufficient, we stay in our current situation.\nWhen \\(\\sigma\\) is known, the test statistic for testings about \\(\\mu\\) is\n\\[\\boxed{ z_{test} = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\color{blue}{\\mu_0}}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} }\\]\nWhen \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown, the test statistic for testings about \\(\\mu\\) is\n\\[\\boxed{ t_{test} = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\color{blue}{\\mu_0}}{s/\\sqrt{n}} }\\]\nFamiliar with them? Those are \\(z\\) score and \\(t\\) score. Those are the sample statistics used for testing. When we calculate the test statistics, we need the value of \\(\\mu\\). What value we should use? You are right if you use the value assumed in \\(H_0\\)! The test statistics are the evidence we use in testing. The evidence is collected under the assumption that \\(\\mu = \\mu_0\\). We collect any evidence to prove that a suspect committed a crime under the assumption that he is innocent, right? We shouldn’t look at any person through colored spectacles, or frame anyone by treating someone as criminal, then make up a fake story for what he’s never done.\n Example Step 3: Calculate the Test Statistic \nSince we don’t know the true \\(\\sigma\\), and only know \\(s\\), we use \\(t\\) distribution and the test statistic is  \\[\\small t_{test} = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}} =  \\frac{147.2 - 150}{5.5/\\sqrt{25}} = -2.55.\\]  So if the true mean blood pressure is 150, our test statistic or evidence is about 2.55 standard deviations below the mean. Is this number too weird or uncommon to believe that the mean blood pressure is really 150? We need a decision rule, and that is what we are going to learn in the step 4.\n\n Step 4-c: Find the Critical Value \nIn this step, we set the decision rule. There are two methods in testing, the critical-value method and the p-value method. The two methods are equivalent, leading to the same decision and conclusion. Let’s first talk about the critical-value method.\nIn step 2, we set the \\(\\alpha\\), and in step 3, we collect the evidence. Now we need a way to decide whether the collected evidence is sufficient or not to reject the \\(H_0\\) claim. The critical value(s) is a value determined by the significance level \\(\\alpha\\) that separates the rejection region or critical region, where we reject \\(H_0\\), from the values of the test statistic that do not lead to the rejection of \\(H_0\\).\n\nWhich critical value to be used depends on whether our test is a right-tailed, left-tailed or two-tailed. The right-tailed test, or right-sided test is the test with \\(H_1: \\mu > \\mu_0\\). When we are interested of \\(\\mu\\) is greater than some value, say \\(\\mu_0\\), in the sampling distribution, we will focus on the right hand side of the distribution, because the evidence, the test statistic calculated in the step 3, will usually be on the right hand side of the distribution, so is the critical value used in the decision rule. Similarly, The left-tailed test, or left-sided test is the test with \\(H_1: \\mu < \\mu_0\\). For a two-tailed or two-sided test, we have \\(H_1: \\mu \\ne \\mu_0\\). In this case, we wonder \\(\\mu\\) is larger or smaller than the assumed \\(\\mu_0\\). So we need to pay attention to both sides of the sampling distribution.\nFigure 15.2 illustrates rejection regions for the different types of hypothesis tests. Let’s assume \\(\\sigma\\) is known as the unknown \\(\\sigma\\) case is similar and we just replace the \\(z\\) score with the \\(t\\) score. Given the significance level \\(\\alpha\\), for a right-tailed test, the critical value is \\(z_{\\alpha}\\), the standard normal quantile so that \\(P(Z > z_{\\alpha}) = \\alpha\\), where \\(Z \\sim N(0, 1)\\). For a right-tailed test, the critical value is \\(-z_{\\alpha}\\), or in fact \\(z_{1-\\alpha}\\), the standard normal quantile so that \\(P(Z < -z_{\\alpha}) = \\alpha\\) or \\(P(Z > -z_{\\alpha}) = 1-\\alpha\\). When the test is a two-tailed test, there are two critical values, one at the right-hand side, the other at the left-hand side of the distribution. Here, we need to split \\(\\alpha\\) equally into \\(\\alpha/2\\), and the critical value at the right-hand side is \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) such that \\(P(Z > z_{\\alpha/2}) = \\alpha\\) and the critical value at the left-hand side is \\(-z_{\\alpha/2}\\) such that \\(P(Z < -z_{\\alpha/2}) = \\alpha/2\\). Note that by definition, \\(z_{\\alpha}\\) and \\(t_{\\alpha, n-1}\\) are always positive and on the right hand side of the distribution.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.2: Rejection regions for the different types of hypothesis tests. Source: https://towardsdatascience.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hypothesis-testing-part-i-4de9abebbc8a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following table is the summary of the critical values under different cases. When \\(\\sigma\\) is known, we use \\(z\\) scores, and when \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown, we use \\(t\\) scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition    \n\nRight-tailed \\((H_1: \\mu > \\mu_0)\\)\n\n\nLeft-tailed \\((H_1: \\mu < \\mu_0)\\)\n\n\nTwo-tailed \\((H_1: \\mu \\ne \\mu_0)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\sigma\\) known\n\\(z_{\\alpha}\\)\n\\(-z_{\\alpha}\\)\n\n\\(-z_{\\alpha/2}\\) and \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\sigma\\) unknown\n\\(t_{\\alpha, n-1}\\)\n\\(-t_{\\alpha, n-1}\\)\n\n\\(-t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}\\) and \\(t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}\\)\n\n\n\n\n Example Step 4-c: Find the Critical Value \nSince the test is a left-tailed test, and \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown and \\(n = 25\\), the critical value is \\(-t_{\\alpha, n-1}\\) that is  \\(\\small -t_{0.05, 25-1} = -t_{0.05, 24} = -1.711.\\) \n\n Step 5-c: Draw a Conclusion Using Critical Value \nThe critical value separates the the standard normal values into the rejection region and non-rejection region. For a right-tailed test, the rejection region is any \\(z\\) value greater than \\(z_{\\alpha}\\), and the non-rejection region is any \\(z\\) value smaller than or equal to \\(z_{\\alpha}\\). For a left-tailed test, the rejection region is any \\(z\\) value small than \\(-z_{\\alpha}\\), and the non-rejection region is any \\(z\\) value greater than or equal to \\(-z_{\\alpha}\\). For a two-tailed test, the rejection region is the union of any \\(z\\) value smaller than \\(-z_{\\alpha/2}\\) and any \\(z\\) value greater than \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\).\nIf the test statistic \\(z_{test}\\) is in the rejection region, we reject \\(H_0\\). If \\(z_{test}\\) is not in the rejection region, we do not or fail to reject \\(H_0\\). Figure 15.3 is an example that we reject \\(H_0\\) in a right-tailed test. The test statistic is 2.5 which is greater than the critical value 1.645, so the test statistic falls in the rejection region.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.3: Test statistic inside of critical region. Source: https://www.thoughtco.com/example-of-a-hypothesis-test-3126398\n\n\n\n\nThe rejection region for any type of tests is shown in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition    \n\nRight-tailed \\((H_1: \\mu > \\mu_0)\\)\n\n\nLeft-tailed \\((H_1: \\mu < \\mu_0)\\)\n\n\nTwo-tailed \\((H_1: \\mu \\ne \\mu_0)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\sigma\\) known\n\\(z_{test} > z_{\\alpha}\\)\n\\(z_{test} < -z_{\\alpha}\\)\n\\(\\mid z_{test}\\mid \\, > z_{\\alpha/2}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\sigma\\) unknown\n\\(t_{test} > t_{\\alpha, n-1}\\)\n\\(t_{test} < -t_{\\alpha, n-1}\\)\n\\(\\mid t_{test}\\mid \\, > t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}\\)\n\n\n\nRemember that a test statistic works as our evidence, and the critical value is a threshold to determine whether the evidence is strong enough. When the test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, it means that from our point of view, the chance of our evidence happening is way too small given the current rules of the game or under \\(H_0\\). Therefore, we don’t think we live in the world of \\(H_0\\), and it probably makes more sense to think we live in the world of \\(H_1\\), and it is commonplace to see these evidence happening.\n Example Step 5-c: Draw a Conclusion Using Critical Value \nWe reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(t_{test} < -t_{\\alpha, n-1}\\). Since  \\(\\small t_{test} = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{147.2 - 150}{5.5/\\sqrt{25}} = -2.55\\)  and  \\(\\small -t_{0.05, 25-1} = -t_{0.05, 24} = -1.711\\) , we have \\(\\small t_{test} = -2.55 < -1.711 = -t_{\\alpha, n-1}\\), so we reject \\(H_0\\).\n\n Step 4-p: Find the P-Value \nAnother decision rule is the p-value method. The \\(p\\)-value measures the strength of the evidence against \\(H_0\\) provided by the data. The smaller the \\(p\\)-value, the greater the evidence against \\(H_0\\). As the name implies, the \\(p\\)-value is the probability of getting a test statistic value that is at least as extreme as the one obtained from the data, assuming that \\(H_0\\) is true. \\((\\mu = \\mu_0)\\). For example, \\(p\\)-value \\(= P(Z \\ge z_{test} \\mid H_0)\\) for a right-tailed test. We are more likely to get a \\(p\\)-value near 0 when \\(H_0\\) is false than when \\(H_0\\) is true. Because when \\(H_0\\) is true, \\(z_{test}\\) will be closer to zero or located around the center of the distribution (the \\(\\mu_0\\) value assumed in \\(H_0\\)), and its p-value will be around 0.5. On the other hand, when \\(H_0\\) is false, or the true \\(\\mu\\) is not \\(\\mu_0\\), the test statistic \\(z_{test}\\) will be farther away from \\(\\mu_0\\) and located at the either tail of the distribution. Therefore, its p-value will be small.\n P-Value Illustration \nSince p-value is a probability, in the distribution, it represents the area under the density curve for values that are at least as extreme as the test statistic’s value. Figure 15.4 shows the p-value for different tests. Note that the p-value for a two-tailed test depends on whether the test statistic is positive or negative. If the calculated test statistic is on the right (left) hand side, the p-value will be the right (left) tail area times two.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.4: Illustration of p-values for different types of hypothesis tests\n\n\n\n\nMathematically, the p-value for any type of tests is shown in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition    \n\nRight-tailed \\((H_1: \\mu > \\mu_0)\\)\n\n\nLeft-tailed \\((H_1: \\mu < \\mu_0)\\)\n\n\nTwo-tailed \\((H_1: \\mu \\ne \\mu_0)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\sigma\\) known\n\\(P(Z > z_{test} \\mid H_0)\\)\n\\(P(Z < z_{test} \\mid H_0)\\)\n\\(2P(Z > \\,\\mid z_{test} \\mid \\, \\mid H_0)\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\sigma\\) unknown\n\\(P(T > t_{test} \\mid H_0)\\)\n\\(P(T < t_{test} \\mid H_0)\\)\n\\(2P(T > \\, \\mid t_{test} \\mid \\, \\mid H_0)\\)\n\n\n\n Example Step 4-p: Find the P-Value \nThis is a left-tailed test, so the \\(p\\)-value is \\(P(T < t_{test})=P(T < -2.55) =\\) 0.01 \n\n Step 5-p: Draw a Conclusion Using P-Value Method \nHow do we use the p-value to make the decision? Well, here the p-value is like our evidence, and the significance level \\(\\alpha\\) is the cut-off for measuring the strength of the evidence. If the \\(p\\)-value \\(\\le \\alpha\\) , we reject \\(H_0\\). If instead the \\(p\\)-value \\(> \\alpha\\), we do not reject or fail to reject \\(H_0\\).\nYes, it is a pretty simple decision rule, but the \\(p\\)-value has been misinterpreted and misused for a long time. When we do a hypothesis testing, it is dangerous to simply compare the size of \\(p\\)-value and \\(\\alpha\\), then jump into the conclusion. You can find more issues of p-value at XXX.\n Example Step 5-p: Draw a Conclusion Using P-Value Method \n We reject \\(H_0\\) if the \\(p\\)-value < \\(\\alpha\\). Since \\(p\\)-value \\(= 0.01 < 0.05 = \\alpha\\), we reject \\(H_0\\).\n\n Both Methods Lead to the Same Conclusion \nRemember I say both critical-value method and \\(p\\)-value method lead to the same conclusion? Figure 15.5 shows why. Test statistic and critical value are variable values, either \\(z\\) or \\(t\\) scores. The p-value and significance level \\(\\alpha\\) are probabilities, either \\(z\\) or \\(t\\) probabilities. The p-value is computed from the test statistic, and \\(\\alpha\\) defines the critical value. The more extreme test statistic implies the smaller p-value, and smaller \\(\\alpha\\) means more extreme critical value. When we reject \\(H_0\\), the following three statements are equivalent:\n\ntest statistic is in the rejection region.\nthe test statistic is more extreme than the critical value\nthe p-value is smaller than \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.5: The conclusion is the same regardless of the method used (Critical Value or P-Value).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following distribution shows the equivalence of the critical-value method and the p-value method in the blood pressure example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 6: Restate the Conclusion in Nontechnical Terms, and Address the Original Claim \nThe final step in the entire hypothesis testing procedure is to make a verbal conclusion, and address the original claim. Figure 15.6 gives you a guideline of how we make a conclusion.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.6: Conclusions based on testing results. Source: https://www.drdawnwright.com/category/statistics/\n\n\n\n\nHere is a reminder. We never say we accept \\(H_0\\). Why can’t we say we “accept the null”? The reason is that we are assuming the null hypothesis is true or the situation we are currently in. We are trying to see if there is evidence against it. Therefore, the conclusion should be in terms of rejecting the null. We don’t accept \\(H_0\\) when we don’t have evidence against it because we are already in the world of \\(H_0\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.7: Meme about hypothesis testing conclusions.

    "text": "15.5 Type I and Type II Errors\nIt is important to remember that hypothesis testing is not perfect, meaning that we may make a wrong decision or conclusion. After all, the collected evidence may not be able to present the full picture of what the true population distribution is. There are two types of errors we may commit when doing hypothesis testing: Type I error and Type II error.\nIf in fact \\(H_0\\) is true, but we wrongly reject it, we commit the type I error. We shouldn’t reject it but we did. If \\(H_0\\) is false, but we don’t reject it, we make the type II error. We should have figured out that \\(H_0\\) does not make sense. The following table tells us when we make a correct decision and when we don’t. In practice, we will not know for certain if we made the correct decision or if we made one of these two errors because we never know the truth!\n\n\n\nDecision\n\n\\(H_0\\) is true\n\n\\(H_0\\) is false\n\n\n\nReject \\(H_0\\)\n\nType I error\nCorrect decision\n\n\nDo not reject \\(H_0\\)\n\nCorrect decision\nType II error\n\n\n\nBack to the crime example that \\(H_0:\\) The person is  not guilty  v.s. \\(H_1:\\) The person is  guilty . We can have a decision table like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision\nTruth is the person innocent\nTruth is the person guilty\n\n\n\nJury decides the person guilty\nType I error\nCorrect decision\n\n\nJury decides the person not guilty\nCorrect decision\nType II error\n\n\n\nIs it worse to wrongly convict an innocent person (Type I error) or to let a perpetrator free (Type II error)? Both hugely negatively impact our society, and if possible, we should make the two errors as rarely as possible.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.9: Example of Type I and Type II errors (https://www.statisticssolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/rachnovblog.jpg)\n\n\n\n\nIt you still don’t get the idea of type I and type II errors, Figure 15.9 is a classical example of the two errors. Of course the null hypothesis is “not pregnant”, and the alternative hypothesis is “pregnant”. Claiming that a old man is expecting a baby is a type I error, and saying a pregnant woman not having a baby is a type II error.\nIn statistics, the probability of committing the type I error is in fact the significance level \\(\\alpha\\).\n\\[\\alpha = P(\\text{type I error}) = P(\\text{rejecting } H_0 \\text{ when } H_0 \\text{ is true})\\]\nIf the evidence occurring with probability lower than 5%, it will be considered sufficient evidence to reject \\(H_0\\), even though \\(H_0\\) is actually the true mechanism giving rise to such evidence.\nWhat is the probability of committing the type II error, the probability that we fail to reject \\(H_0\\) when \\(H_0\\) is a false statement? We call the probability \\(\\beta\\):\n\\[\\beta = P(\\text{type II error}) = P(\\text{failing to reject } H_0 \\text{ when } H_0 \\text{ is false})\\]\n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\) and sample size \\(n\\) are related. If we choose any two of them, the third is automatically determined. We would of course prefer \\(\\alpha\\) to be small since we would not like to conclude in favor of the research hypothesis falsely. But given the sample size, small \\(\\alpha\\) leads to a large \\(\\beta\\). On the other hand, too small \\(\\alpha\\) would most likely result in no discovery because we are gonna be conservative, set the threshold too high, and do not reject lots of \\(H_0\\) that should be rejected. In practice, we specify \\(\\alpha\\) beforehand, and then select \\(n\\) that is practical, so the \\(\\beta\\) is determined.\nIt would be great if we correctly reject \\(H_0\\) when \\(H_0\\) is actually false. We hope the probability of having this to be large. The probability is actually \\(1-\\beta\\), which is called the power of a test. The power depends on the same factors as \\(\\beta\\) does, including the size of \\(\\alpha\\), the sample size, and the true value of parameter."

    "text": "16.1 Introduction\n Why Compare Two Populations? \nWe’ve discussed estimation (Chapter 13) and hypothesis testing (Chapter 15) for one single population mean \\(\\mu.\\) The methods we learned can only be used for one sample or population. However, quite often we are faced with a comparison of parameters from different populations. For example,\n\n Comparing the mean annual income for Male and Female groups. \n Testing if a diet used for losing weight is effective from Placebo samples and New Diet samples. \n\nIf these two samples are drawn from two target populations with means, \\(\\mu_1\\) and \\(\\mu_2\\) respectively, the testing problem can be formulated as  \\[\\begin{align}\n  &H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 \\\\ &H_1: \\mu_1 > \\mu_2\n  \\end{align}\\] \nwhere \\(\\mu_1\\) for example is the male mean annual income and \\(\\mu_2\\) is the female mean annual income Or \\(\\mu_1\\) is the mean weight loss from the New Diet group, and \\(\\mu_2\\) is the mean weight loss from the Placebo group.\nTo compare two means, we need two samples, one for one mean. But the two samples may be dependent or independent, and the methods for comparing two means depend on whether the two samples are dependent or not. So let’s see what dependent and independent samples are.\n\n Dependent and Independent Samples \nThe two samples used to compare two population means can be independent or dependent.\n\n\nTwo samples are dependent or matched pairs if the sample values are matched, where the matching is based on some inherent relationship. For example,\n\n Height data of fathers and daughters, where the height of each dad is matched with the height of his daughter.  Clearly, father and daughter share the same life style, genes, and other factors that affect both father and daughter’s height. So the taller the father is, the taller the daughter tends to be. Their heights are positively correlated. In the two sample data sets, the first father height in the father’s sample is paired with the first daughter height in the daughter’s sample. Same for the second pair, third pair, and so on.\n Weights of subjects measure before and after some diet treatment, where the subjects are the same both before and after treatments.  In this example, we again have two samples. The two samples are dependent because the subjects in the two samples are identical. Your weight today is of course related to your weight last week, right? In the two sample data sets, the first weight in the sample before diet treatment is paired with the first weight in the sample after treatment. The two sample values belong to the same person. Same for the second pair, third pair, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dependent Samples (Matched Pairs) \nFrom the two examples, we learn that subject 1 may refer to\n\nthe first matched pair (dad-daughter)\nthe same person with two measurements (before and after treatment)\n\nIf we have data with only one variable, in R the data is usually saved as a vector. When we have two samples, the two samples can be saved as a vector separately, or saved as a data matrix with the two samples combined by columns like the table below. Each row is for one matched pair, or the same subject. One column is for one sample data. Note that since every subject in dependent samples is paired, the two samples are of the same size \\(n\\).\n\n\nSubject\n(Dad) Before\n(Daughter) After\n\n\n\n1\n\\(x_{b1}\\)\n\\(x_{a1}\\)\n\n\n2\n\\(x_{b2}\\)\n\\(x_{a2}\\)\n\n\n3\n\\(x_{b3}\\)\n\\(x_{a3}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\n\\(n\\)\n\\(x_{bn}\\)\n\\(x_{an}\\)\n\n\n\n Independent Samples \n\n\nTwo samples are independent if the sample values from one population are not related to the sample values from the other. For example,\n\n Salary samples of men and women, where the two samples are drawn independently from the male and female groups. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may want to compare the mean salary level of male and female. What we can do is to collect two samples independently, one for each group, from their own population. Any subject in the male group has nothing to do with any subject in the female group, and any subject in the male group cannot be paired with any subject in the female group in any way.\nThe independent samples can be summarized as the table below. Notice that the two samples can have different sample sizes, \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) for example. Because the subjects in the two samples are not paired, we can collect salary data from 50 males and 65 females. In the data table, \\(x_{14}\\) means the 4th subject measurement in the first group, and \\(x_{23}\\) means the 3rd subject measurement in the second group. In general, \\(x_{ij}\\) is the \\(j\\)-th measurement in the \\(i\\)-th group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject of Group 1 (Male)\nMeasurement of Group 1\nSubject of Group 2 (Female)\nMeasurement of Group 2\n\n\n\n1\n\\(x_{11}\\)\n1\n\\(x_{21}\\)\n\n\n2\n\\(x_{12}\\)\n2\n\\(x_{22}\\)\n\n\n3\n\\(x_{13}\\)\n3\n\\(x_{23}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\n\\(n_1\\)\n\\(x_{1n_1}\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(n_2\\)\n\\(x_{2n_2}\\)\n\n\n\n\n Inference from Two Samples \nThe statistical methods are different for these two types of samples. The good news is the concepts of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for one population can be applied to two-population cases.\nLet’s quickly review the confidence interval and test statistic in the one-sample case.\n\\(\\text{CI = point estimate} \\pm \\text{margin of error (E)}\\)\n\ne.g., \\(\\overline{x} \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, n-1} \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)\n\n\nMargin of error = critical value \\(\\times\\) standard error of the point estimator\nThe 6 testing steps are the same, and both critical value and \\(p\\)-value method can be applied too.\n\ne.g., \\(t_{test} = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}}\\)"

We can conduct a test like  \\[\\begin{align}\n  &H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 \\\\ &H_1: \\mu_1 \\ne \\mu_2\n  \\end{align}\\] \nThe null hypothesis can also be written as \\(H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0\\). We don’t really want to know the value of \\(\\mu_1\\) and/or \\(\\mu_2\\), and we just care about if they are equal, or their difference is zero. Therefore, if we let \\(\\mu_d\\) be the difference \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\), we can write our hypothesis as \\[\\begin{align}\n  &H_0: \\mu_d = 0 \\\\ &H_1: \\mu_d \\ne 0\n  \\end{align}\\] \nor more generally for any types of test,\n \\[\\begin{align} & H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0 \\iff \\mu_d = 0 \\\\ & H_1: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 > 0 \\iff \\mu_d > 0 \\\\ & H_1: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 < 0 \\iff \\mu_d < 0  \\\\ & H_1: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\ne 0 \\iff \\mu_d \\ne 0 \\end{align}\\] \nFor dependent samples, we just transform the two samples into one difference sample by taking the difference between paired measurements. We use the difference sample to do the inference about the mean difference. The data table below illustrate the idea. We create a new difference sample data \\((d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n)\\) where the \\(i\\)-th sample difference is \\(x_{1i} - x_{2i}\\), the difference between the \\(i\\)-th measurement in the first sample and the \\(i\\)-th measurement in the second sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\n\\(x_1\\)\n\\(x_2\\)\nDifference \\(d = x_1 - x_2\\)\n\n\n\n1\n\\(x_{11}\\)\n\\(x_{21}\\)\n\\(\\color{red}{d_1}\\)\n\n\n2\n\\(x_{12}\\)\n\\(x_{22}\\)\n\\(\\color{red}{d_2}\\)\n\n\n3\n\\(x_{13}\\)\n\\(x_{23}\\)\n\\(\\color{red}{d_3}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\color{red}{\\vdots}\\)\n\n\n\\(n\\)\n\\(x_{1n}\\)\n\\(x_{2n}\\)\n\\(\\color{red}{d_n}\\)\n\n\n\nThe sample \\((d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n)\\) is used to estimate the mean difference \\(\\mu_d = \\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\). So what is our point estimate of \\(\\mu_d\\)? The point estimate is the sample average of \\((d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n)\\) which is \\(\\overline{d}\\). Actually, the point estimate is equal to \\(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2\\), the estimate for \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\).\n\n\n\n\n Inference for Paired Data \nHere are the requirements for the inference for paired data. The sample differences \\(\\color{blue}{d_i}\\)s form a random sample, and they are from a normal distribution and/or the sample size \\(n > 30\\). Remember that when analyzing paired data, we focus on the difference of measurements, and this \\(d_i\\) sample becomes our new one single sample for inference about one single population parameter, the mean difference \\(\\mu_d\\).\n\nWith this, the inference for paired data follows the same procedure as the one-sample \\(t\\)-test! Therefore, the test statistic is \\[\\color{blue}{t_{test} = \\frac{\\overline{d}-\\mu_d}{s_d/\\sqrt{n}}} = \\frac{\\overline{d}-0}{s_d/\\sqrt{n}} \\sim T_{n-1}\\] under \\(H_0\\) where \\(\\overline{d}\\) and \\(s_d\\) are the mean and standard deviation of the difference samples \\((d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n)\\).\n\nThe critical value is either \\(t_{\\alpha, n-1}\\) or \\(t_{\\alpha/2, n-1}\\) depending on if it is a one-tailed or two-tailed test. Below is a table summarizing information necessary to make inferences about paired data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaired \\(t\\)-test\nTest Statistic\nConfidence Interval for \\(\\mu_d = \\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\sigma_d\\) is unknown\n\\(\\large t_{test} = \\frac{\\overline{d}}{s_d/\\sqrt{n}}\\)\n\\(\\large \\overline{d} \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, n-1} \\frac{s_d}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)\n\n\nThe test for matched pairs is called a paired \\(t\\)-test.\n\n Example \nConsider a capsule used to reduce blood pressure (BP) for individuals with hypertension. A sample of 10 individuals with hypertension takes the medicine for 4 weeks. The BP measurements before and after taking the medicine are shown in the table below. Does the data provide sufficient evidence that the treatment is effective in reducing BP?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject\nBefore \\((x_b)\\)\n\nAfter \\((x_a)\\)\n\nDifference \\(d = x_b - x_a\\)\n\n\n\n1\n143\n124\n19\n\n\n2\n153\n129\n24\n\n\n3\n142\n131\n11\n\n\n4\n139\n145\n-6\n\n\n5\n172\n152\n20\n\n\n6\n176\n150\n26\n\n\n7\n155\n125\n30\n\n\n8\n149\n142\n7\n\n\n9\n140\n145\n-5\n\n\n10\n169\n160\n9\n\n\n\nGiven the data \\(x_b\\) and \\(x_a\\), we first take the difference and create the new data \\(d = x_b - x_a\\) for each subject.\n Step 1 \n\nIf we let \\(\\mu_1 =\\) Mean Before, \\(\\mu_2 =\\) Mean After, and \\(\\mu_d = \\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\), then the hypothesis is  \\(\\begin{align} &H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 \\iff \\mu_d = 0\\\\ &H_1: \\mu_1 > \\mu_2 \\iff \\mu_d > 0 \\end{align}\\)  The key is that “the treatment is effective in reducing BP” means the mean BP after taking the medicine is lower than that before, so \\(\\mu_1 > \\mu_2\\).\n\n Step 2 \n\n \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) \n\n Step 3 \nFor the \\(d\\) sample, \\(\\overline{d} = 13.5\\), \\(s_d= 12.48\\).  \\(t_{test} = \\frac{\\overline{d}}{s_d/\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{13.5}{12.48/\\sqrt{10}} = 3.42.\\) \n Step 4-c \n\nThis is a right-tailed test.  \\(t_{\\alpha, n-1} = t_{0.05, 9} = 1.833\\).\n\n\n Step 5-c \n\n We reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\small t_{test} > t_{\\alpha, n-1}\\). Since \\(\\small t_{test} = 3.42 > 1.833 = t_{\\alpha, n-1}\\), we reject \\(H_0\\).\n\n Step 6 \n\n There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that the drug is effective in reducing blood pressure. \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.1: Illustration of right-tailed test for blood pressure example\n\n\n\n\nThe 95% CI for \\(\\mu_d = \\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) is \\[\\begin{align}\\overline{d} \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, df} \\frac{s_d}{\\sqrt{n}} &= 13.5 \\pm t_{0.025, 9}\\frac{12.48}{\\sqrt{10}}\\\\ &= 13.5 \\pm 8.927 \\\\ &= (4.573, 22.427).\\end{align}\\]\nWe are 95% confident that the mean difference in blood pressure is between 4.57 and 22.43. Since the interval does NOT include 0, it leads to the same conclusion as rejection of \\(H_0\\).\n\n Two-Sample Paired \\(t\\)-Test in R \nBelow is the same data as in the previous hypertension example.

The alternative argument is either “two.sided”, “less” or “greater”. We have \\(H_1: \\mu_1 > \\mu_2\\) or \\(\\mu_d > 0\\), so we use “greater”. The argument \\mu is the difference in means in \\(H_0\\), which is zero in our case.

However, the one-sided 95% confidence interval shown in the output is not what we want! We may have a one-sided or two-sided test, but we should always use the two-sided confidence interval. When you use the t.test() function to do a one-sided test as we do here, please do not use the confidence interval in the output."

    "section": "\n16.3 Inference About Two Means: Independent Samples",
    "text": "16.3 Inference About Two Means: Independent Samples\n Compare Population Means: Independent Samples \nFrequently we would like to compare two different groups. For example,\n\nWhether stem cells can improve heart function. Here the two samples are patients with the stem cell treatment and the ones without the stem cell treatment.\nThe relationship between pregnant women’s smoking habits and newborns’ weights. Here the two samples are women who smoke and women who don’t.\nWhether one variation of an exam is harder than another variation. In this case, the two samples are students having exam A and students taking exam B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn those examples, the two samples are independent. In this section, we are going to learn how to compare their population means. For example, whether the mean score of exam A is higher than the mean score of exam B.\n\n Testing for Independent Samples \\((\\sigma_1 \\ne \\sigma_2)\\) \nWhen we deal with two independent samples, we assume they are drawn from two independent populations which are assumed to be normally distributed in this chapter. We are interested in whether the two population means are equal or which is greater. But to do the inference, we need to take care of their standard deviation, \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\). First we discuss the case when \\(\\sigma_1 \\ne \\sigma_2\\).\nThe requirements of testing for independent samples with \\(\\sigma_1 \\ne \\sigma_2\\) are\n\nThe two samples are independent.\nBoth samples are random samples.\n\n\\(n_1 > 30\\), \\(n_2 > 30\\) and/or both samples are from a normally distributed population. Large sample sizes are for the application of the central limit theorem. Note that both sample sizes should be large or at least greater than 30. If either one sample size is small, the inference methods discussed here are not valid.\n\nWe are interested in whether the two population means, \\(\\mu_1\\) and \\(\\mu_2\\), are equal or if one is larger than the other. Therefore, we have \\[H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2\\]\nThis is equivalent to testing if their difference is zero, or \\(H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe start by finding a point estimator for \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\). What is the best point estimator for \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2\\) is the best point estimator for \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\)!\n\n\n\n Sampling Distribution of \\(\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2\\) \nAgain, to do the inference we start with the associated sampling distribution. If the two samples are from independent normally distributed populations or \\(n_1 > 30\\) and \\(n_2 > 30\\), then at least approximately\n\\[\\small \\overline{X}_1 \\sim N\\left(\\mu_1, \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} \\right), \\quad \\overline{X}_2 \\sim N\\left(\\mu_2,\n\\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2} \\right)\\]\nBecause we use \\(\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2\\) to estimate \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\), we need the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2\\). We won’t talk about the details, but it can be shown that \\(\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2\\) has the sampling distribution \\[\\small \\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2 \\sim N\\left(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2, \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} \\color{red}{+} \\color{black}{\\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}} \\right). \\] Before careful that the variance is the sum of the variance of \\(\\overline{X}_1\\) and \\(\\overline{X}_2\\), even the random variable is their difference. Please take MATH 4700 Introduction to Probability to learn more about the properties of normal distribution.\nTherefore by standardization, we have a standard normal variable \\[\\small Z = \\frac{(\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2) - (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} \\sim N(0, 1)\\]\n Test Statistic for Independent Samples \\((\\sigma_1 \\ne \\sigma_2)\\) \nWith \\(D_0\\) being a hypothesized value, our testing problem could be one of the followings\n\n \\(\\small \\begin{align} &H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\le D_0\\\\ &H_1: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 > D_0 \\end{align}\\)  (right-tailed)\n \\(\\small \\begin{align} &H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\ge D_0\\\\ &H_1: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 < D_0 \\end{align}\\)  (left-tailed)\n \\(\\small \\begin{align} &H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = D_0\\\\ &H_1: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\ne D_0 \\end{align}\\)  (two-tailed)\n\nOften, we care about of the two means are equal, so \\(D_0\\) is zero. But \\(D_0\\) could be any number that fits your research question. For example, you may wonder if mean weight of male is greater than the mean weight of female by 20 pounds. Then your \\(H_1\\) would be \\(H_1: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 > 20\\) where \\(\\mu_1\\) is the mean weight of male and \\(\\mu_2\\) is the mean weight of female, and \\(D_0\\) is 20.\nIf \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) are known, with the \\(\\overline{x}_1\\), \\(\\overline{x}_2\\) calculated by our sample, and under the null hypothesis, the test statistic is the z-score from the sampling distribution which is \\[z_{test} = \\frac{(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) - (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} = \\frac{(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) - \\color{blue}{D_0}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}.\\]\nThen we are pretty much done. We find \\(z_{\\alpha}\\) or \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) and follow our testing steps!\nWhat if \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) are unknown? You should be able to sense the answer. The test statistic becomes \\(t_{test}\\):\n\\[t_{test} = \\frac{(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) - (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\color{red}{s_1^2}}{n_1} + \\frac{\\color{red}{s_2^2}}{n_2}}} = \\frac{(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) - \\color{blue}{D_0}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\color{red}{s_1^2}}{n_1} + \\frac{\\color{red}{s_2^2}}{n_2}}}. \\]\nWe simply replace the unknown \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) with their corresponding sample estimate \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\)! The critical value is either \\(t_{\\alpha, df}\\) (one-tailed) or \\(t_{\\alpha/2, df}\\) (two-tailed) with the degrees of freedom\n\\[df = \\dfrac{(A+B)^2}{\\dfrac{A^2}{n_1-1}+ \\dfrac{B^2}{n_2-1}},\\] where \\(\\small A = \\dfrac{s_1^2}{n_1}\\) and \\(\\small B = \\dfrac{s_2^2}{n_2}\\).\nThe degrees of freedom looks intimidating, but no worries you don’t need to memorize the formula, and we let the statistical software take care of it. To be conservative (tend to reject \\(H_0\\) less) if the \\(df\\) is not an integer, we round it down to the nearest integer, it does not matter much though.\n Inference About Independent Samples \\((\\sigma_1 \\ne \\sigma_2)\\) \nBelow is a table that summarizes ways to make inferences about independent samples when \\((\\sigma_1 \\ne \\sigma_2)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\large \\color{red}{\\sigma_1 \\ne \\sigma_2}\\)\nTest Statistic\nConfidence Interval for \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\)\n\n\n\n\nknown\n\\(\\large z_{test} = \\frac{(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) - \\color{blue}{D_0}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}\\)\n\\(\\large (\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}\\)\n\n\nunknown\n\\(\\large t_{test} = \\frac{(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) - \\color{blue}{D_0}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\color{red}{s_1^2}}{n_1} + \\frac{\\color{red}{s_2^2}}{n_2}}}\\)\n\\(\\large (\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, df} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\color{red}{s_1^2}}{n_1} + \\frac{\\color{red}{s_2^2}}{n_2}}\\)\n\n\n\nFor unknown \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\), we use \\(\\small df = \\dfrac{(A+B)^2}{\\dfrac{A^2}{n_1-1}+ \\dfrac{B^2}{n_2-1}},\\) where \\(\\small A = \\dfrac{s_1^2}{n_1}\\) and \\(\\small B = \\dfrac{s_2^2}{n_2}\\) to get the \\(p\\)-value, critical value and confidence interval. The unequal-variance t-test is called Welch’s t-test in the literature.\n Example: Two-Sample t-Test \n\n\nDoes an over-sized tennis racket exert less stress/force on the elbow?

Now we are talking about the case when \\(\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2\\). Because they are equal, the two \\(\\sigma\\)s can be treated as one common \\(\\sigma\\).\n Sampling Distribution of \\(\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2\\) \nAgain, we start with the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2\\) \\[\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2 \\sim N\\left(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2, \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2} \\right).\\] If \\(\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma\\), we can write \\[\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2 \\sim N\\left(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2, \\sigma^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2} \\right) \\right).\\] Therefore, \\[ Z = \\frac{(\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2) - (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}} \\sim N(0, 1).\\]\n Test Statistic for Independent Samples \\((\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma)\\) \nSimilar to the case that \\(\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2\\), if \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) are known, the test statistic is the z-score of \\(\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2\\) under \\(H_0\\): \\[z_{test} = \\frac{(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) - (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}} = \\frac{(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) - \\color{blue}{D_0}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}} \\]\nIf \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) are unknown, we use \\(t_{test}\\) just like we would for the one-sample case. Now here is the key point. We don’t know the common \\(\\sigma\\). How do we use the two independent samples to construct one point estimate of \\(\\sigma\\), so that the estimate can replace \\(\\sigma\\) in the z-score to get the \\(t\\) test statistic?\n\nThe idea is to use the so-called pooled sample variance to estimate the common population variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\):\n\\[ s_p^2 = \\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2} \\]\nAs \\(\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma\\), we just need one sample standard deviation to replace the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\). The two samples are from the populations with the same variance, and \\(s_1^2\\) and \\(s_2^2\\) are estimating the same population variance. But we just need one estimate. The idea is to combine the two sample variances \\(s_1^2\\) and \\(s_2^2\\) together, so that we can use all the information from the two samples to obtain one single point estimate \\(s_p^2\\) for \\(\\sigma^2\\). The pooled estimate \\(s_p^2\\) is in fact the weighted average of \\(s_1^2\\) and \\(s_2^2\\) weighted by their corresponding degrees of freedom \\(n_1-1\\) and \\(n_2-1\\). The idea is that when the sample size is large, we tend to get a more precise estimate. So \\(s_p^2\\) would be closer to \\(s_1^2\\) or \\(s_2^2\\) whichever has large sample size.\n\nIf \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) are unknown, we replace \\(\\sigma\\) with \\(s_p\\) and get the \\(t\\) test statistic\n\\[t_{test} = \\frac{(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) - (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)}{{\\color{red}{s_p}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}} = \\frac{(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) - \\color{blue}{D_0}}{{\\color{red}{s_p}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}}\\] Here, the critical value is either \\(t_{\\alpha, df}\\) (for one-tailed tests) or \\(t_{\\alpha/2, df}\\) (for two-tailed tests), and the \\(t\\) distribution used to compute the \\(p\\)-value has the degrees of freedom \\[df = n_1 + n_2 - 2\\] Yes, that simple.\n Inference from Independent Samples \\((\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma)\\) \nBelow is a table that summarizes ways to make inferences about independent samples when \\(\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\large \\color{red}{\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2}\\)\nTest Statistic\nConfidence Interval for \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\)\n\n\n\n\nknown\n\\(\\large z_{test} = \\frac{(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) - \\color{blue}{D_0}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}}\\)\n\\(\\large (\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}\\)\n\n\nunknown\n\\(\\large t_{test} = \\frac{(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) - \\color{blue}{D_0}}{{\\color{red}{s_p}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}}\\)\n\\(\\large (\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, df} {\\color{red}{s_p}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}\\)\nUse \\(df = n_1+n_2-2\\) to get the \\(p\\)-value, critical value and confidence interval.\nThe test from two independent samples with \\(\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma\\) is usually called two-sample pooled \\(z\\)-test or two-sample pooled \\(t\\)-test.\n\n Example: Weight Loss \n\n\nA study was conducted to see the effectiveness of a weight loss program. Two groups (Control and Experimental) of 10 subjects were selected. The two populations are normally distributed and have the same standard deviation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data on weight loss was collected at the end of six months, and the revelant sample statistics\n\nControl: \\(n_1 = 10\\), \\(\\overline{x}_1 = 2.1\\, lb\\), \\(s_1 = 0.5\\, lb\\)\nExperimental: \\(n_2 = 10\\), \\(\\overline{x}_2 = 4.2\\, lb\\), \\(s_2 = 0.7\\, lb\\)\n\nIs there a sufficient evidence at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) to conclude that the program is effective? If yes, construct a 95% CI for \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) to show how much effective it is.\n Step 1 \n\nLet \\(\\mu_1\\) be the mean weight loss in the control group, and \\(\\mu_2\\) be the mean weight loss in the experimental group. Then we have  \\(\\begin{align} &H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 \\\\ &H_1: \\mu_1 < \\mu_2 \\end{align}\\) \n\n\n\\(\\mu_1 < \\mu_2\\) means the weight loss program, the program the experimental group are in, is effective because on average the participants in the the experimental group loss weights more than those in the control group.\n Step 2 \n\n \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) \n\n Step 3 \n\nFrom the question we know \\(\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2\\). So the test statistic is  \\(t_{test} = \\frac{(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) - \\color{blue}{D_0}}{{\\color{red}{s_p}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}}\\). \n\n\\(s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(10-1)0.5^2 + (10-1)0.7^2}{10+10-2}}=0.6083\\)\n \\(t_{test} = \\frac{(2.1 - 4.2) - 0}{0.6083\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10}}} = -7.72\\)\n\n\n\n Step 4-c \n\n \\(df = n_1 + n_2 - 2 = 10 + 10 - 2 = 18\\). So \\(-t_{0.05, df = 18} = -1.734\\). \n\n Step 5-c \n\n We reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\small t_{test} < -t_{\\alpha, df}\\). Since \\(\\small t_{test} = -7.72 < -1.734 = -t_{\\alpha, df}\\), we reject \\(H_0\\).\n\n Step 4-p \n\n The \\(p\\)-value is \\(P(T_{df=18} < t_{test}) \\approx 0\\) \n\n Step 5-p \n\n We reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(p\\)-value < \\(\\alpha\\). Since \\(p\\)-value \\(\\approx 0 < 0.05 = \\alpha\\), we reject \\(H_0\\).\n\n Step 6 \n\n There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that the weight loss program is effective. \n\nThe 95% CI for \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) is \\[\\begin{align}(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2) \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, df} {\\color{red}{s_p}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}} &= (2.1 - 4.2) \\pm t_{0.025, 18} (0.6083)\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10}}\\\\ &= -2.1 \\pm 0.572 = (-2.672, -1.528) \\end{align}\\]\nWe are 95% confident that the difference in the mean weight loss is between -2.672 and -1.528. Since the interval does not include 0, it leads to the same conclusion as rejection of \\(H_0\\).\n Two-Sample Pooled t-Test in R \n\n## Prepare values\nn1 = 10; x1_bar = 2.1; s1 = 0.5\nn2 = 10; x2_bar = 4.2; s2 = 0.7\n\n## pooled sample standard deviation\nsp <- sqrt(((n1 - 1) * s1 ^ 2 + (n2 - 1) * s2 ^ 2) / (n1 + n2 - 2))\n\n## degrees of freedom\ndf <- n1 + n2 - 2\n\n## t_test\n(t_test <- (x1_bar - x2_bar) / (sp * sqrt(1 / n1 + 1 / n2)))\n\n[1] -7.719754\n\n## t_cv\nqt(p = 0.05, df = df)\n\n[1] -1.734064\n\n## p_value\npt(q = t_test, df = df)\n\n[1] 2.028505e-07"

    "text": "17.1 Inference for One Population Variance\n\n Inference for Population Variances \nLet’s start with inference for one population variance. For point estimation, the most intuitive and straightforward point estimator for \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the sample variance \\(S^2\\) defined as\n\\[S^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \\overline{X})^2}{n-1}.\\]\nNote that the the denominator is \\(n-1\\), not the sample size \\(n\\). Note that \\(S^2\\) is a random variable because each data point \\(X_i\\) and \\(\\overline{X}\\) are assumed random variables. Dividing by \\(n-1\\) instead of \\(n\\) actually means something. \\(S^2\\) is an unbiased estimator for \\(\\sigma^2\\), i.e., \\(E(S^2) = \\sigma^2\\), which is a good property of a point estimator. If we were able to repeatedly collect data sets of the same size \\(n\\) lots of times, and for each data set we obtain its sample variance, then the average sample variance will be, if not exactly, very close to the true population variance.\nThe inference methods for \\(\\sigma^2\\) introduced in this chapter require the population to be normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nThe inference methods can work poorly if normality is violated, even if the sample is large.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Chi-Square \\(\\chi^2\\) Distribution \nRemember that when we do the inference for population means, we use either normal distribution or Student’s \\(t\\) distribution. For the inference about the population variances, we use another distribution called chi-square \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution because the distribution is related to the sampling distribution of some variable involving \\(S^2\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\). We’ll talk about that later. Let’s first learn a little about the chi-square \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution.\n\n\n\n\nAs Student’s \\(t\\) distribution, the chi-square \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution has one parameter, degrees of freedom \\(df\\). To denote a specific chi-square distribution, we write \\(\\chi^2_{df}\\) like \\(\\chi^2_{2}\\) for a chi-square distribution or variable with degrees of freedom two. Figure 17.1 shows \\(\\chi^2\\) distributions with varying degrees of freedom. It is in general a right-skewed distribution, but it gets more and more symmetric as \\(df\\) gets larger. Also, the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution is defined over positive numbers, one hint why we use it for inferring variances because variance is non-negative, but normal or \\(t\\) distribution is defined on the whole real line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.1: Illustration of \\(\\chi^2\\) distributions with varying degrees of freedom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Upper Tail and Lower Tail of Chi-Square \nLike standard normal and \\(t\\) distribution, to do the inference for variances, we get to find or define critical values of a chi-square distribution. With some probability \\(\\alpha\\), we define\n\n\\(\\chi^2_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2},\\, df}\\) is a \\(\\chi^2\\) value of a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with degrees of freedom \\(df\\) such that it has area to the right of \\(\\alpha/2\\).\n\\(\\chi^2_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2},\\, df}\\) is a \\(\\chi^2\\) value of a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with degrees of freedom \\(df\\) such that it has area to the left of \\(\\alpha/2\\). In other words, it has area to the right of \\(1 - \\alpha/2\\), and that’s why it has a subscript \\(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\).\n\nFigure 17.2 illustrates the \\(\\chi^2\\) critical values. Notice that in \\(N(0, 1)\\), \\(z_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} = -z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}\\). Because of the symmetry of the distribution, the \\(z\\)-value having area \\(\\alpha/2\\) on the right is the \\(z\\)-value having area \\(\\alpha/2\\) on the left with a negative sign. However, the chi-square distribution is not symmetric, so \\(\\chi^2_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2},\\,df} \\ne -\\chi^2_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2},\\,df}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.2: Illustration of \\(\\alpha/2\\) significance levels for \\(\\chi^2_{df}\\) distribution\n\n\n\n\n Sampling Distribution \nWhen a random sample of size \\(n\\) is from \\(\\color{red}{N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)}\\), the following sample statistic has the \\(\\chi^2\\) sampling distribution with degrees of freedom \\(n-1\\): \\[ \\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\sigma^2} \\sim \\chi^2_{n-1}. \\]\nI would like to stress again that the inference method for \\(\\sigma^2\\) introduced here can work poorly if the normality assumption is violated, even for large samples.\nThe sample statistic involves \\(S^2\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\), so we have manipulate its sampling distribution to obtain the confidence interval for \\(\\sigma^2\\), and use it as a test statistic in the hypothesis testing for \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) Confidence Interval for \\(\\sigma^2\\) \nThe \\((1-\\alpha)100\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\sigma^2\\) is \\[\\color{blue}{\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\chi^2_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}, \\, n-1}}, \\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\chi^2_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}, \\, n-1}} \\right)}}\\]\nHow do we get this interval?

Please construct a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval for population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe just need to get what we need for constructing the interval from the sample data, sample size \\(n\\), sample variance \\(s^2\\), \\(\\alpha\\), critical values \\(\\chi^2_{\\alpha/2, n-1}\\) and \\(\\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2, n-1}\\).\n\n\n\\(n = 16\\), \\(s^2 = 3.4\\), \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\).\n\\(\\chi^2_{\\alpha/2, n-1} = \\chi^2_{0.025, 15} = 27.49\\)\n\\(\\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2, n-1} = \\chi^2_{0.975, 15} = 6.26\\)\n\nNote that we want the interval for \\(\\sigma\\), not \\(\\sigma^2\\), we take a square root of the lower and upper bound of the interval for \\(\\sigma^2\\). The \\(95\\%\\) CI for \\(\\sigma\\) is \\(\\small \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\chi^2_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}, \\, n-1}}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\chi^2_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}, \\, n-1}}} \\right) = \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{(16-1)(3.4)}{27.49}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{(16-1)(3.4)}{6.26}}\\right) = (1.36, 2.85)\\)\nWe are 95% confident that the height of supermodels has standard deviation between 1.36 and 2.85.\n Confidence Interval Computation in R \nWe use qchisq() to get the \\(\\chi^2\\) critical values.

Use \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) to test the claim that “supermodels have heights with a standard deviation that is less than the standard deviation, \\(\\sigma = 7.5\\) cm, for the population of women”.\n Step 1 \n\nWe are comparing the \\(\\sigma\\) of heights of supermodels with the \\(\\sigma\\) of heights of women in general which is 7.5. So the hypothesize value \\(\\sigma_0\\) is 7.5. We wonder if supermodel height standard deviation is smaller than 7.5. Therefore, we have test \\(H_0: \\sigma = \\sigma_0\\) vs. \\(H_1: \\sigma < \\sigma_0\\), where \\(\\sigma_0 = 7.5\\) cm.\n\n Step 2 \n\n\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)\n\n Step 3 \n\nThe test statistic comes from the variable \\(\\chi_{test}^2 = \\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\\sigma^2}\\) that follows \\(\\chi^2_{n-1}\\) distribution. Under \\(H_0\\), we have \\(\\chi_{test}^2 = \\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\sigma_0^2} = \\frac{(16-1)(3.4)}{7.5^2} = 0.91\\), drawn from \\(\\chi^2_{n-1}\\).\n\n Step 4-c \n\nThis is a left-tailed test.\nThe critical value is \\(\\chi_{1-\\alpha, df}^2 = \\chi_{0.95, 15}^2 = 7.26\\)\n\n\n Step 5-c \n\nReject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_1\\) if \\(\\chi_{test}^2 < \\chi_{1-\\alpha, df}^2\\).\nSince \\(0.91 < 7.26\\), we reject \\(H_0\\). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 6 \n\nThere is sufficient evidence to support the claim that supermodels have heights with a standard deviation that is less than the standard deviation for the population of all women.\n\nWe conclude that the heights of supermodels vary less than heights of women in the general women population.\n\n Back to Pooled t-Test \nIn a two sample pooled t-test, we assume\n\n \\(n_1 \\ge 30\\) and \\(n_2 \\ge 30\\) or that both samples are drawn from normal populations. \n \\(\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2\\) \n\nWe can use a QQ-plot (and normality tests, Anderson, Shapiro, etc.) to check the assumption of a normal distribution. We now learn how to check the assumption \\(\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2\\)."

    "text": "18.2 Inference for a Single Proportion\n Hypothesis Testing for \\(\\pi\\) \nThe point estimator for the population proportion \\(\\pi\\) is the sample proportion \\(Y/n\\). The true probability is approximated by the relative frequency in the sample data. Let’s first learn how to do testing for \\(\\pi\\). This is the one-sample proportion \\(z\\) test.\n\n Step 0: Method Assumptions \n\nThe method requires that  \\(n\\pi_0 \\ge 5\\) and \\(n(1-\\pi_0) \\ge 5\\)  where \\(\\pi_0\\) is the hypothesized value or the value to be tested. The larger \\(n\\pi_0\\) and \\(n(1-\\pi_0)\\) are, the better. In fact, the method relies on the central limit theorem, and uses standard normal distribution to do the test. Large \\(n\\pi_0\\) and \\(n(1-\\pi_0)\\) leads to better normal approximation.\n\n Step 1: Set the Null and Alternative Hypothesis \n\nWe are interested in the proportion of some category being equal to, greater than or less than some value.  \\(\\begin{align} &H_0: \\pi = \\pi_0 \\\\ &H_1: \\pi > \\pi_0 \\text{ or } \\pi < \\pi_0 \\text{ or } \\pi \\ne \\pi_0 \\end{align}\\) \n\n\n Step 2: Set the Significance Level, \\(\\alpha\\) \n Step 3: Calculate the Test Statistic \n\nWith the central limit theorem, it can be shown that the sampling distribution of the statistic \\(Y/n\\) is approximately normal with mean \\(\\pi\\) and standard error, \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi(1-\\pi)}{n}}\\). Therefore, \\[Z = \\frac{Y/n - \\pi}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi(1-\\pi)}{n}}} \\dot\\sim N(0, 1).\\] Then under the null \\(H_0\\), the test statistic is  \\(z_{test} = \\dfrac{\\hat{\\pi} - \\pi_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_0(1-\\pi_0)}{n}}}\\) where \\(\\hat{\\pi} = \\frac{y}{n}\\) is the realized sample proportion. \n\n\n Step 4-c: Find the Critical Value \\(z_{\\alpha}\\) (one-tailed) or \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) (two-tailed) \n\nSame as before.\n\n Step 5-c: Draw a Conclusion Using Critical Value Method \n\n \\(H_1: \\pi > \\pi_0\\): Reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_1\\) if \\(z > z_{\\alpha}\\) \n \\(H_1: \\pi < \\pi_0\\): Reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_1\\) if \\(z < -z_{\\alpha}\\) \n \\(H_1: \\pi \\ne \\pi_0\\): Reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_1\\) if \\(|z| > z_{\\alpha/2}\\) \n\n Step 6: Restate the Conclusion in Nontechnical Terms, and Address the Original Claim \n\n Confidence Interval for \\(\\pi\\) \nTo construct the confidence interval for \\(\\pi\\), we rely on some assumption too. Unlike testing that has a hypothesized value \\(\\pi_0\\), there is no hypothesized value in confidence interval, and we only use information from the data to get an interval. To ensure that the normal approximation is fairly good, the interval formula requires \\(n\\hat{\\pi} \\ge 5\\) and \\(n(1-\\hat{\\pi}) \\ge 5\\).  Can you see the difference between this requirement and the testing requirement?\n\n\nThe \\(100(1 - \\alpha)\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\pi\\) is \\[\\hat{\\pi} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi(1-\\pi)}{n}}\\] where \\(\\hat{\\pi} = y/n\\). Since \\(\\pi\\) is unknown, we use its estimate \\(\\hat{\\pi}\\) instead: \\[\\hat{\\pi} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}(1-\\hat{\\pi})}{n}}\\]\nSuch normal approximation interval is called the Wald interval.   \n\n Example: Exit Poll \nSuppose we collect data on 1,000 voters in an election with only two candidates, R and D, and every voter must vote for either one of them.\n\n\n\n\nVoter\nR\nD\n\n\n\n1\nx\n\n\n\n2\n\nx\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\n1000\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the data, we want to predict who won the election. Let \\(Y\\) be the number of voters that voted for R. Assume the count, \\(Y\\), is sampled from \\(binomial(n = 1000, \\pi)\\), and \\(\\pi = P(\\text{a voter voted for R}) =\\) (population) proportion of all voters that for R. Parameter \\(\\pi\\) is the unknown parameter to be estimated or tested. In an exit poll of 1,000 voters, 520 voted for R. At \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), predict whether or not R won the election.\n\n\n\n\n Hypothesis Testing \n Step 0 \n\n\n\\(\\pi_0 = 1/2\\).  \\(n\\pi_0 = 1000(1/2) = 500 \\ge 5\\) and \\(n(1-\\pi_0) \\ge 5\\) \n\n\n Step 1 \n\n\nR won the election means that the proportion of all voters voting for R is greater than 50%.  \\(\\begin{align} &H_0: \\pi \\le 1/2 \\\\ &H_1: \\pi > 1/2 \\text{ (more than half voted for R)} \\end{align}\\) \n\n\n Step 2 \n\n \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) \n\n Step 3 \n\n \\(z_{test} = \\frac{\\hat{\\pi} - \\pi_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_0(1-\\pi_0)}{n}}} = \\frac{\\frac{520}{1000} - 0.5}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{1000}}} = 1.26\\) \n\n Step 4-c \n\n \\(z_{\\alpha} = z_{0.05} = 1.645\\) \n\n Step 5-c \n\n Reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_1\\) if \\(z_{test} > z_{\\alpha}\\). \n Since \\(z_{test} < z_{\\alpha}\\), we do not reject \\(H_0\\). \n\n Step 6 \n\n We do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that R won. \nWe make the same conclusion using the \\(p\\)-value method.\n\n\\[ p\\text{-value} = P(Z > 1.26) = 0.1 > 0.05\\]\n Confidence Interval \nFirst we check the assumption: + \\(n\\hat{\\pi} = 1000(0.52) = 520 \\ge 5\\) and \\(n(1-\\hat{\\pi}) = 480 \\ge 5\\).\n\nEstimate the proportion of all voters that voted for R using a 95% confidence interval.\n\n\\[\\hat{\\pi} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}(1-\\hat{\\pi})}{n}} = 0.52 \\pm z_{0.025}\\sqrt{\\frac{0.52(1-0.52)}{1000}} = (0.49, 0.55).\\]\n Computation in R \n\nTo perform the one-sample proportion \\(z\\) test in R, we use the function prop.test(). The argument correct tells us whether or not we want to do continuity correction. Our method here does not do continuity correction. It does not matter much when our method assumption is satisfied.\nTo obtain the confidence interval, we should set alternative = \"two.sided\" because the interval is two sided. Be careful. The interval we learn is the Wald interval. However, the interval from the prop.test() output is not the Wald interval, but the so-called Wilson interval. There are lots of variants of confidence intervals for binomial proportions, and one can use the BinomCI() function in the DescTools package to obtain them.\n\n## one proportion test using normal approximation\nprop.test(x = 520, n = 1000, p = 0.5, alternative = \"greater\", \n          correct = FALSE)\n\n\n    1-sample proportions test without continuity correction\n\ndata:  520 out of 1000, null probability 0.5\nX-squared = 1.6, df = 1, p-value = 0.103\nalternative hypothesis: true p is greater than 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.4939945 1.0000000\nsample estimates:\n   p \n0.52 \n\n# Use alternative = \"two.sided\" to get CI\nprop_ci <- prop.test(x = 520, n = 1000, p = 0.5, \n                     alternative = \"two.sided\", correct = FALSE)\nprop_ci$conf.int\n\n[1] 0.4890177 0.5508292\nattr(,\"conf.level\")\n[1] 0.95\n\n## The Wilson interval and Wald interval\nDescTools::BinomCI(x = 520, n = 1000, method = \"wilson\")\n\n      est    lwr.ci    upr.ci\n[1,] 0.52 0.4890177 0.5508292\n\nDescTools::BinomCI(x = 520, n = 1000, method = \"wald\")\n\n      est    lwr.ci    upr.ci\n[1,] 0.52 0.4890351 0.5509649\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDoing inference with normal approximation to binomial variables is more complicated than what we discuss here.

If the requirement of the normal approximation method we learn is not met, the exact binomial test should be used. When the sample size is large, and the expected proportion is not extreme being close to 0 or 1, the normal approximation method and the exact binomial test have pretty similar inference results.\nWe can use binom.test() function to perform the exact binomial test.

We can assume \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) both follow binomial distribution but with their own parameters, \\(n_1\\) and \\(\\pi_1\\) for \\(Y_1\\), and \\(n_2\\) and \\(\\pi_2\\) for \\(Y_2\\). Political analysts may want to know whether or not the male presidential approval rate \\(\\pi_1\\) is higher than the female approval rate \\(\\pi_2\\).\n\n\n\n\nGroup 1\nGroup 2\n\n\n\n\n\\(n_1\\) trials\n\n\\(n_2\\) trials\n\n\n\n\\(Y_1\\) number of successes\n\n\\(Y_2\\) number of successes\n\n\n\\(Y_1 \\sim binomial(n_1, \\pi_1)\\)\n\\(Y_2 \\sim binomial(n_2, \\pi_2)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\pi_1\\): Population proportion of success of Group 1\n\n\\(\\pi_2\\): Population proportion of success of Group 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hypothesis Testing for \\(\\pi_1\\) and \\(\\pi_2\\) \nThe method introduced here is based on the central limit theorem and normal approximation to binomial distribution. The idea is similar to the one sample proportion \\(z\\) test, and we perform two sample proportion \\(z\\) test.\n Step 0: Check Method Assumptions \n\nIn order to perform the \\(z\\) test, the following requirements must be met:  \\(n_1\\hat{\\pi}_1 \\ge 5\\), \\(n_1(1-\\hat{\\pi}_1) \\ge 5\\) and \\(n_2\\hat{\\pi}_2 \\ge 5\\), \\(n_2(1-\\hat{\\pi}_2) \\ge 5\\) \n\n\n Step 1: Set the Null and Alternative Hypothesis \n\n \\(\\begin{align} &H_0: \\pi_1 = \\pi_2 \\\\ &H_1: \\pi_1 > \\pi_2 \\text{ or } \\pi_1 < \\pi_2 \\text{ or } \\pi_1 \\ne \\pi_2 \\end{align}\\) \n\n Step 2: Set the Significance Level, \\(\\alpha\\) \n Step 3: Calculate the Test Statistic \n\nIt can be shown that \\[\\frac{\\frac{Y_1}{n_1} - \\frac{Y_2}{n_2} - (\\pi_1 - \\pi_2)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_1(1-\\pi_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{\\pi_2(1-\\pi_2)}{n_2}}} \\dot\\sim N(0, 1)\\] Under the null hypothesis, \\(\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi\\), with the sample data, the statistic is reduced to \\[\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}_1 - \\hat{\\pi}_2}{\\sqrt{\\pi(1-\\pi)(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2})}},\\] where \\(\\hat{\\pi}_1 = y_1/n_1\\) and \\(\\hat{\\pi}_2 = y_2/n_2\\). We still cannot use this quantity as a test statistic because it involves the unknown parameter \\(\\pi\\). Like two sample pooled \\(t\\) test, since \\(\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi\\) under \\(H_0\\), we combine the two samples using all the trials to get a better pooled sample proportion \\(\\bar{\\pi} = \\frac{y_1+y_2}{n_1+n_2}\\) to estimate the common proportion \\(\\pi\\). Therefore, the test statistic is\n\n \\[z_{test} = \\dfrac{\\hat{\\pi}_1 - \\hat{\\pi}_2}{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\pi}(1-\\bar{\\pi})(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2})}}.\\] \n Step 4-c: Find the Critical Value \\(z_{\\alpha}\\) (one-tailed) or \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) (two-tailed) \nSame before.\n Step 5-c: Draw a Conclusion Using Critical Value Method \n\n\n Reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_1\\) if \n\n \\(H_1: \\pi_1 > \\pi_2\\): Reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_1\\) if \\(z > z_{\\alpha}\\) \n \\(H_1: \\pi_1 < \\pi_2\\): Reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_1\\) if \\(z < -z_{\\alpha}\\) \n \\(H_1: \\pi_1 \\ne \\pi_2\\): Reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_1\\) if \\(|z| > z_{\\alpha/2}\\) \n\n\n\n Step 6: Restate the Conclusion in Nontechnical Terms, and Address the Original Claim \n\n Confidence Interval for \\(\\pi_1 - \\pi_2\\)\nTo get the Wald confidence interval for \\(\\pi_1 - \\pi_2\\), it requires\n\\(n_1\\hat{\\pi}_1 \\ge 5\\), \\(n_1(1-\\hat{\\pi}_1) \\ge 5\\) and \\(n_2\\hat{\\pi}_2 \\ge 5\\), \\(n_2(1-\\hat{\\pi}_2) \\ge 5\\). Again, no hypothesized values, and sample proportions are used.\nThe \\(100(1 - \\alpha)\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\pi_1 - \\pi_2\\) is \\[\\hat{\\pi}_1 - \\hat{\\pi}_2 \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}_1(1-\\hat{\\pi}_1)}{n_1}+\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}_2(1-\\hat{\\pi}_2)}{n_2}}\\]\nThere is no pooled estimate \\(\\bar{\\pi}\\) in the interval because the interval is not constructed under the hypothesis that \\(\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi\\). The parameters \\(\\pi_1\\) and \\(\\pi_2\\) are estimated separately by the individual sample proportions \\(\\hat{\\pi}_1\\) and \\(\\hat{\\pi}_2\\).\n\n Example: Effectiveness of Learning \n\n\nSuppose we do a study on 300 students to compare the effectiveness of learning statistics in online vs. in-person programs. We randomly assign 125 students to the online program, and the remaining 175 to the in-person program. The exam results are shown in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Unsplash-JESHOOTS.COM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExam Results\nOnline Instruction\nIn-Person Instruction\n\n\n\nPass\n94\n113\n\n\nFail\n31\n62\n\n\nTotal\n125\n175\n\n\n\nIs there sufficient evidence to conclude that the online program is more effective than the traditional in-person program at \\(\\alpha=0.05\\)? \n Hypothesis Testing \n Step 0 \n\n \\(\\hat{\\pi}_1 = 94/125 = 0.75\\) and \\(\\hat{\\pi}_2 = 113/175 = 0.65\\). \n \\(n_1\\hat{\\pi}_1 = 94 > 5\\), \\(n_1(1-\\hat{\\pi}_1) = 31 > 5\\), and \\(n_2\\hat{\\pi}_2 = 113 > 5\\), \\(n_2(1-\\hat{\\pi}_2) = 62 > 5\\) \n\nThe assumptions are satisfied.\n Step 1 \n\nLet \\(\\pi_1\\) \\((\\pi_2)\\) be the population proportion of students passing the exam in the online (in-person) program.  \\(H_0: \\pi_1 = \\pi_2\\) vs. \\(H_1: \\pi_1 > \\pi_2\\) \n\n\n Step 2 \n\n \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) \n\n Step 3 \n\n \\(\\bar{\\pi} = \\frac{94+113}{125+175} = 0.69\\) \n \\(z_{test} = \\dfrac{\\hat{\\pi}_1 - \\hat{\\pi}_2}{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\pi}(1-\\bar{\\pi})(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2})}} = \\frac{0.75 - 0.65}{\\sqrt{0.69(1-0.69)(\\frac{1}{125} + \\frac{1}{175})}} = 1.96\\) \n\n Step 4-c \n\n \\(z_{\\alpha} = z_{0.05} = 1.645\\) \n\n Step 5-c \n\n Reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_1\\) if \\(z_{test} > z_{\\alpha}\\). \n Since \\(z_{test} > z_{\\alpha}\\), we reject \\(H_0\\). \n\n Step 6 \n\n We have sufficient evidence to conclude that the online program is more effective. \n\n Confidence Interval \nWe want to know how effective the online program is, so we estimate \\(\\pi_1 - \\pi_2\\) using a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval\n\\[\\hat{\\pi}_1 - \\hat{\\pi}_2 \\pm z_{0.05/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}_1(1-\\hat{\\pi}_1)}{n_1}+\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}_2(1-\\hat{\\pi}_2)}{n_2}}\\]  The 95% confidence interval is \\[0.75 - 0.65 \\pm 1.96\\sqrt{\\frac{(0.75)(1-0.75)}{125} + \\frac{(0.65)(1-0.65)}{175}}\\\\\n= (0.002, 0.210)\\]\nBecause 0 is not included in this interval, we reach the same conclusion as the hypothesis testing.\n Implementation in R \nBelow is a demonstration of how to make inferences about two proportions in R. We still use prop.test() function, but here we provide the number of successes and the number of trials in the arguments x and n respectively as a vector whose first element is for the first group and second element for the second group.

    "section": "\n19.2 Test of Independence",
    "text": "19.2 Test of Independence\nSo far we consider one categorical variable with general \\(k\\) categories. In some situations, we have two categorical variables being considered, and we wonder if one affects the other distribution. Formally, we want to test whether or not the two variables are independent each other. The test doing this is the independence test.\n Contingency Table and Expected Count\n Contingency Table \nLet’s start with an example. A popular question in politics is “Does the opinion of the President’s job performance depend on gender?” This question may involve two categorical variables such as\n\nJob performance: approve, disapprove, no opinion\nGender: male, female\n\nTo answer such question, as every other test, we collect our data and see if there is any sufficient evidence to say the two variables are dependent. When two categorical variables are involved, we usually summarize the data in a contingency table or two-way frequency/count table as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nApprove\nDisapprove\nNo Opinion\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nMale\n18\n22\n10\n50\n\n\n\nFemale\n23\n20\n12\n55\n\n\n\nTotal\n41\n42\n22\n105\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we consider a two-way table, we often would like to know, are these variables related in any way? That is, are they dependent (versus independent)? If President’s approval rate has nothing to do with gender, the Job performance distributions in the male and female groups should be similar or consistent. In other words, whether or not the person is male or female does not affect how President’s job performance is viewed.\n Expected Count \nThe idea is similar to goodness-of-fit test. We first calculate the expected count in each cell (Total row and column are excluded) in the contingency table, the count we expect to see under the condition that the two variables are independent. We always do our analysis in the world of null hypothesis that two variables have no relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\nApprove\nDisapprove\nNo Opinion\nTotal\n\n\n\nMale\n18 (19.52)\n22 (20)\n10 (10.48)\n50\n\n\nFemale\n23 (21.48)\n20 (22)\n12 (11.52)\n55\n\n\nTotal\n41\n42\n22\n105\n\n\n\nThe expected count for the \\(i\\)-th row and \\(j\\)-th column, which is listed in parentheses in the table above, is calculated by: \\[\\text{Expected Count}_{\\text{row i; col j}} = \\frac{\\text{(row i total}) \\times (\\text{col j total})}{\\text{table total}}\\] For example, the expected count of Disapprove in the Female group is \\[\\text{Expected Count}_{\\text{row 2; col 2}} = \\frac{\\text{(row 2 total}) \\times (\\text{col 2 total})}{\\text{table total}} = \\frac{42 \\times 55}{105} = 22.\\]\nWe are ready for doing test of independence once all expected counts are obtained.\n\n Test of Independence Procedure \nThe test of independence requires that every expected count \\(E_{ij} \\ge 5\\) in the contingency table. The higher the better.\nAs we discussed before, we believe the variables are independent unless strong evidence says they are not. So our hypotheses are  \\[\\begin{align} &H_0: \\text{Two variables are independent }\\\\ &H_1: \\text{The two are dependent (associated) } \\end{align}\\]\nThe test statistic formula is pretty similar to the test of goodness-of-fit. The test of independence is also a chi-squared test. The chi-squared test statistic is\n\\[\\chi^2_{test} = \\sum_{i=1}^r\\sum_{j=1}^c\\frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}},\\] where \\(r\\) is the number of rows and \\(c\\) is the number of columns in the contingency table. The idea is the same as the test of goodness-of-fit. Under the assumption of independence, if the observed counts are far away from the counts we should expect to see, we get a larger test statistic, and tend to conclude that the independence assumption is not reasonable.\nThe chi-squared test is right-tailed, so we reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\chi^2_{test} > \\chi^2_{\\alpha, \\, df}\\), where \\(df = (r-1)(c-1)\\).\n Example \n\n\n\nApprove\nDisapprove\nNo Opinion\nTotal\n\n\n\nMale\n18 (19.52)\n22 (20)\n10 (10.48)\n50\n\n\nFemale\n23 (21.48)\n20 (22)\n12 (11.52)\n55\n\n\nTotal\n41\n42\n22\n105\n\n\n\n \\[\\begin{align} &H_0: \\text{ Opinion does not depend on gender } \\\\ &H_1: \\text{ Opinion and gender are dependent } \\end{align}\\]\nThe test statistic is \\[\\small \\chi^2_{test} = \\frac{(18 - 19.52)^2}{19.52} + \\frac{(22 - 20)^2}{20} + \\frac{(10 - 10.48)^2}{10.48} + \\frac{(23 - 21.48)^2}{21.48} + \\frac{(20 - 22)^2}{22} + \\frac{(12 - 11.52)^2}{11.52}= 0.65\\]\nThe critical value is \\(\\chi^2_{\\alpha, df} =\\chi^2_{0.05, (2-1)(3-1)} = 5.991\\). Since \\(\\chi_{test}^2 < \\chi^2_{\\alpha, df}\\), we do not reject \\(H_0\\). Therefore we fail to conclude that the opinion of the President’s job performance depends on gender.\n Test of Independence in R \nCalculating all the expected counts is tedious, especially when the variables have many categories. In practice we never calculate them by hand, and use computing software to do so. Below is an example of how to perform the test of independence using R. Since the test of independence is a chi-squared test, we still use the chisq.test() function. This time we need to prepare the contingency table as a matrix, and put the matrix in the x argument in the function. That’s it! R does everything for us. If we save the result as an object like ind_test which is a R list, we can get access to information related to the test, such as the expected counts ind_test$expected.\n\n(contingency_table <- matrix(c(18, 23, 22, 20, 10, 12), nrow = 2, ncol = 3))\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]   18   22   10\n[2,]   23   20   12\n\n## Using chisq.test() function\n(ind_test <- chisq.test(x = contingency_table))\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  contingency_table\nX-squared = 0.65019, df = 2, p-value = 0.7225\n\n## extract expected counts\nind_test$expected\n\n         [,1] [,2]     [,3]\n[1,] 19.52381   20 10.47619\n[2,] 21.47619   22 11.52381\n\n## critical value\nqchisq(0.05, df = (2 - 1) * (3 - 1), lower.tail = FALSE)  \n\n[1] 5.991465"

    "text": "8.1 Random Variables\nIn Chapter 2, we learn that a variable in a data set is a characteristic or attribute that varies from one object to another. A variable can be either categorical or numerical. For example, gender is categorical and height is numerical. In addition, numerical variables can be either discrete or continuous. A discrete variable takes on values of a finite or countable number, while a continuous variable takes on values anywhere over a particular range without gaps or jumps. So the number of conferences Dr. Yu attended last year is discrete, and college GPA is continuous.\nWe know variables in a data set vary from one to another. If a variable takes numerical values, and its value is determined by some chance or randomness of a procedure or experiment, then we say the variable is a random variable, usually denoted as \\(X\\) or other capital English letters, \\(Y\\), \\(Z\\) for example.\nUsually a capital letter represents a random variable and a small letter represents a realized value of that random variable. For example, \\(X\\) is weight which is a random variable, and \\(x\\) is a realized value of \\(X\\) that can be any possible value of \\(X\\), for example, \\(X = 170\\) means the realized value \\(x\\) is 170.\n\nOther random variable examples are\n\n\\(X\\) = # of heads after flipping a coin twice.\n\\(X\\) = # of accidents in W. Wisconsin Ave. per day\n\nNote that \\(X\\) must follow some randomness pattern, and its realized value cannot be known in advance unless we collect the data or realize it.\nTo accounting for its randomness, a random variable has a probability distribution associated with it. The probability distribution governs the behavior of the random variable, indicating the range of the possible values, and what values are more probable to be realized than others. Probability distribution is key to uncertainty quantification in statistical inference and machine learning prediction. Figure 8.1 below shows the many different types of probability distributions, and we’ll discuss a few basic but important probability distributions in Chapter 9 and Chapter 10.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Source: https://github.com/rasmusab/distribution_diagrams\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a random variable is defined, \\(X = x\\) or \\(a < X < b\\) or any specification about the values of \\(X\\) represents some event of some experiment. Consider the experiment that one tosses a fair coin twice independently, and define the random variable \\(X\\) as the number of heads. Then \\(\\{X = 0\\}\\) is the event \\(\\{\\text{tails}, \\text{tails}\\}\\) meaning that the first toss ends up with tails, so does the second toss. \\(\\{X = 1\\}\\) is the event \\(\\{\\text{tails}, \\text{heads}\\}\\) or \\(\\{\\text{heads}, \\text{tails}\\}\\) because heads can be shown up in the first toss or the second toss. \\(\\{X = 2\\}\\) corresponds to the event \\(\\{\\text{heads}, \\text{heads}\\}\\)."

The display can be a table, graph or mathematical formula of \\(P(X = x)\\) as long as every possible value of \\(X\\) has its own corresponding probability. We illustrate the probability function using an example of tossing a coin.\n Example:🪙🪙 Toss a fair coin twice independently where \\(X\\) is the number of heads. \nWith the example, first the possible values of \\(X\\) by its definition are 0, 1, and 2. Both results can be tails and \\(X = 0\\). We can have one heads and one tails, or \\(X=1\\), and we can have two heads showing up \\(X = 2\\). We cannot have \\(X=3\\) or any number greater than 2 because the coin is tossed twice only. Also, the possible value of \\(X\\) cannot be any non-integer values, like 1.5 or 0.8 because \\(X\\) is the number times, and it is discrete.\nTo present its probability distribution in a table, for each possible value of \\(X\\), we get to compute its probability, then list all probabilities as the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n0\n1\n2\n\n\nP(X = x)\n0.25\n0.5\n0.25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me show the calculation of the probabilities.\n\n\\(P(X = 0) = P(\\{\\text{tails}, \\text{tails}\\}) = P(\\text{tails})P(\\text{tails}) = (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25.\\)\n\\(\\begin{align*} P(X = 1) &= P(\\{\\text{heads}, \\text{tails}\\} \\cup \\{\\text{tails}, \\text{heads}\\})\\\\ &= P(\\{\\text{heads}, \\text{tails}\\}) + P(\\{\\text{tails}, \\text{heads}\\}) \\\\ &= (0.5)(0.5) + (0.5)(0.5) = 0.5. \\end{align*}\\)\n\\(P(X = 2) = P(\\{\\text{heads}, \\text{heads}\\}) = P(\\text{heads})P(\\text{heads}) = (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25.\\)\n\nWe can also display the probability distribution using graphs. We put possible values of \\(X\\) in the x-axis, and the y-axis stands for the probability \\(P(X=x)\\). Then for each \\(x\\), we draw a vertical bar at \\(X=x\\) from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = P(X=x)\\). Figure 9.1 shows the discrete probability distribution of two coin flips as a graph.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Discrete probability distribution of two coin flips as a graph\n\n\n\n\nIf you love math, you can specify the probability distribution using mathematical formula: \\[\nP(X = x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n{2 \\choose x}\\left( \\frac{1}{4}\\right), ~~ x = 0, 1, 2,\\\\\n0,  ~~ \\text{otherwise},\n\\end{cases}\n\\] where \\({2 \\choose x} = \\frac{2!}{x!(2-x)!}\\). Keep in mind that where \\(x\\) takes values or the support of \\(x\\) should be clearly specified.\nNow let’s talk a little bit about the properties of pmf.\n\n\\(0 \\le P(X = x) \\le 1\\) for every value \\(x\\) of \\(X\\). Remember that \\(P(X = x)\\) is a probability of some event, for example \\(P(X = 0) = P(\\{\\text{tails}, \\text{tails}\\})\\), and we’ve learned that \\(0 \\le P(A) \\le 1\\) for any event \\(A\\). \nThe probabilities for a discrete \\(X\\) are additive because \\(\\{X = a\\}\\) and \\(\\{X = b\\}\\) are disjoint for any possible values \\(a \\ne b\\). In our coin tossing example, \\(\\{X = 0\\}\\) and \\(\\{X = 1\\}\\) are disjoint because when tossing a fair coin two times independently, we cannot have no heads and one heads results at the same time. Therefore, \\[P(X = 0 \\text{ or } 1) = P(\\{X = 0\\} \\cup \\{X = 1\\}) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1).\\]\n\\(\\sum_{x}P(X=x) = 1\\), where \\(x\\) assumes all possible values. In our coin tossing example, \\(P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 1\\). The reason is that \\(\\{X = 0\\}\\), \\(\\{X = 1\\}\\), and \\(\\{X = 2\\}\\) form a partition of the entire sample space, where in the example \\(\\mathcal{S} = \\left\\{ \\{\\text{tails}, \\text{tails}\\}, \\{\\text{heads}, \\text{tails}\\}, \\{\\text{tails}, \\text{heads}\\}, \\{\\text{heads}, \\text{heads}\\} \\right\\}\\). Therefore, \\(\\sum_{x}P(X=x) = P(\\mathcal{S}) = 1\\).\n\n\n Mean \nRemember that a probability distribution describes the randomness pattern of a random variable \\(X\\). Given its distribution, people are usually interested in its average value or central tendency and how uncertain it is or its dispersion.\nFor the central tendency, we consider the mean of a discrete variable \\(X\\). Suppose \\(X\\) takes values \\(x_1, \\dots, x_k\\) with probabilities \\(P(X = x_1), \\dots, P(X = x_k)\\). The mean or expected value of \\(X\\), written as \\(E(X)\\), is the sum of each outcome multiplied by its corresponding probability: \\[E(X) := x_1 \\times P(X = x_1) + \\dots + x_k \\times P(X = x_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^kx_iP(X=x_i)\\]\nThe Greek letter \\(\\mu\\) may also be used in place of the notation \\(E(X)\\).\nThe mean of a discrete random variable \\(X\\) is actually a weighted average of \\(x\\) weighted by their corresponding probability. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the mean of \\(X\\) (the number of heads) in the coin example?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you calculate it correctly, your answer should be one. It tells us that if we toss a fair coin twice independently, on average we’ll see one heads showing up.\n\n Variance \nAs sample variance calculated from the sample data, we calculate the variance of the random variable \\(X\\) to quantify its variability and dispersion. Suppose \\(X\\) takes values \\(x_1, \\dots , x_k\\) with probabilities \\(P(X = x_1), \\dots, P(X = x_k)\\) and expected value \\(\\mu = E(X)\\). The variance of \\(X\\), denoted by \\(Var(X)\\) or \\(\\sigma^2\\), is\n\\[\\small \\begin{align*} Var(X) &:= (x_1 - \\mu)^2 \\times P(X = x_1) + \\dots + (x_k - \\mu)^2 \\times P(X = x_k) \\\\ &= \\sum_{i=1}^k(x_i - \\mu)^2P(X=x_i) \\\\ &= E[(X-\\mu)^2] \\end{align*}.\\]\nThe standard deviation of \\(X\\), \\(\\sigma\\), is the square root of the variance.\nIntuitively, the variance of a discrete random variable \\(X\\) is the weighted sum of squared deviation from the mean weighted by probability values. It is the mean squared distance from the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the variance of \\(X\\) (the number of heads) in the previous example?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\nThe mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)) of a random variable or probability distribution are not the same as the sample mean (\\(\\overline{x}\\)) and sample variance (\\(s^2\\)) calculated from the sample data. Their main difference will be discussed in the Part Inference.\n\n\n\n\nWe have learned the general discrete probability distributions. Next we are going to learn two popular discrete probability distributions, binomial and Poisson distribution."

    "text": "Statistics can be divided into two parts: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. The descriptive statistics part has been discussed in Part Summarizing Data including Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, and many of you probably already learned lots of it in your middle or high school. The core and why statistics is that useful in every part of our life is its inferential techniques.\nWe have been equipped with sufficient probability tools for learning basic statistical inference. We’ll start with the very basic concept of statistical inference followed by inferential methods for various kinds of data and research questions.\nInferential statistics uses the information contained in the sample data to learn about some unknown target population characteristic of our interest. For example, we are interested in the mean height of the adults in the United States. The budget and/or time constraint, however, keep us from taking the census and knowing the height of every adult in the United States. Instead, we collected a sample data, and hopefully with a fair statistical method, we are able to use the height data in the sample to estimate the mean height of the adults in the United States as precisely as possible.\n\nTo be honest, statistical inference is a huge and difficult task. To simply our work, we usually assume the target population follows some distribution but with unknown parameters. Then our goal is to learn or uncover the unknown parameters of the assumed population distribution. For example, we can assume the height of the adults in the United States is normally distributed but with its mean \\(\\mu\\) unknown. Then our goal is to estimate the mean height \\(\\mu\\) from our data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we only collect a small part of the entire population as our sample, we never see the entire picture and only have partial information, and the conclusion we made based on the sample, with pretty high chance, may be different or even far away from the unknown truth. Also, as we learned in Chapter 11, our sample data vary due to its randomness nature. In statistics, we not only learn what we learn about the unknown parameter, but also learn how uncertain we are about what we learn.\nIn statistical inference, there are two main approaches in parameter learning: estimation and hypothesis testing. We are going to learn how to estimate and test on the unknown parameters for various types of data and questions. Get ready and let’s go!"

Let \\(X\\) be the categorical variable Gender with 2 categories, Male and Female. Our data table may look like the following. The first subject is Male, so we mark it in the Male column. The second subject is Female, so we check it in the Female column, and so on.\n\n\n\n\nSubject\nMale\nFemale\n\n\n\n1\nx\n\n\n\n2\n\nx\n\n\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\n\\(n\\)\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we collect the categorical data, usually we are interested in their count. We wonder which category has more counts than the other. So we can make a one-way frequency/count table as follows. It is one-way because the count table is for one categorical variable only. Here in the data there are \\(y\\) males and \\(n-y\\) females, where \\(n\\) is the sample size.\n\nOne-way frequency/count table\n\n\n\n\\(X\\)\nCount\n\n\n\nMale\n\\(y\\)\n\n\nFemale\n\\(n-y\\)\n\n\n\nNow the number of males or the proportion of males can be viewed as a random variable because the count, \\(Y\\), or the proportion \\(Y/n\\) varies from sample to sample. Suppose you want to learn the proportion of male students at Marquette, what would you do. You would probably randomly sample some Marquette students, and count how many of them are males, right? If you do the sampling again, the count will be different from the count you got previously. Therefore, to learn the male proportion, we could use the sample proportion \\(Y/n\\) as an estimator that follows some (sampling) distribution.\nOne question for you. What probability distribution might be appropriate for the count, \\(Y\\)? \n\n Probability Distribution for Count Data: Two Levels \nIn our example, each subject is either Male or Female, and with the fixed sample size, we wonder how many subjects are Males. Any probability distribution comes into your mind? Well, \\(binomial(n, \\pi)\\) could be a good option for count data with 2 categories.\n\nFixed number of trials:  We can view each sampled subject as one trial in the experiment, and we have fixed \\(n\\) subjects. \n\nEach trial results in one of two outcomes.  Clearly, in our survey, there are only two possible answers. Each subject is either Male or Females. \n\nTrials are independent.  If the subjects are randomly sampled, the students in the sample are independent. \n\nThe probability of success \\(\\pi\\) is constant:  The proportion of being in category Male is \\(\\pi\\), which is constant at the given point of time. \n\n\nThe count \\(Y\\) of male students, or the number of success, has the binomial probability \\[P(Y = y \\mid n, \\pi) = \\frac{n!}{y!(n-y)!}\\pi^{y}(1-\\pi)^{n-y}\\]\nDo we know \\(\\pi\\)? Absolutely not! The parameter \\(\\pi\\) is the proportion (or relative frequency) of male students, which is what we want to estimate and learn from data. Therefore, our goal is to estimate or test the population proportion, \\(\\pi\\), of the category Male given the assumption that the count of Male \\(Y\\) is binomially distributed \\(Y \\sim binomial(n, \\pi)\\)."

    "text": "19.1 Test of Goodness of Fit\n\n\nA citizen in Wauwatosa, WI is curious about the question:\n\nAre the selected jurors racially representative of the population?\n\n\n\n\nWell the idea is that if the jury is representative of the population, once we collect our sample of juries, the sample proportions should reflect the proportions of the population of eligible jurors (i.e. registered voters).\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://stock.adobe.com/images/diverse-group-of-business-people/116680830\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose from the government we learn the distribution of registered voters based on races. We then collect 275 jurors racial information, and see if the racial distribution of the sample is kind of consistent with the registered voter racial distribution. The count information is summarized in the table below.\n\n\n\nWhite\nBlack\nHispanic\nAsian\nTotal\n\n\n\nRepresentation in juries\n205\n26\n25\n19\n275\n\n\nRegistered voters\n0.72\n0.07\n0.12\n0.09\n1.00\n\n\n\nThe first thing we can do is convert the count into proportion or relative frequency, so that the sample proportion and the target proportion can be easily paired and compared.\n\n\n\nWhite\nBlack\nHispanic\nAsian\nTotal\n\n\n\nRepresentation in juries\n0.745\n0.095\n0.091\n0.069\n1.00\n\n\nRegistered voters\n0.72\n0.07\n0.12\n0.09\n1.00\n\n\n\nWhile the proportions in the juries do not precisely represent the population proportions, it is unclear whether these data provide convincing evidence that the sample is not representative. If the jurors really were randomly sampled from the registered voters, we might expect small differences due to chance. However, unusually large differences may provide convincing evidence that the juries were not representative. Specifically, we want a test to answer the question\n\nAre the proportions of juries close enough to the proportions of registered voters, so that we are confident saying that the jurors really were randomly sampled from the registered voters?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs the binomial case, the multi-class counts \\(O_1, O_2 \\dots O_k\\) and proportions \\(O_1/n, O_2/n \\dots O_k/n\\) are random variables before actual data are collected. Their value varies from sample to sample.\n\n\nThe test we need is the goodness-of-fit test.\n\n Goodness-of-Fit Test \nA goodness-of-fit test tests the hypothesis that the observed frequency distribution fits or conforms to some claim distribution. In the jury example, our observed (relative) frequency distribution is \\((0.745, 0.095, 0.091, 0.069)\\) and the claim distribution is the racial distribution of registered voters \\((0.72, 0.07, 0.12, 0.09)\\). The jury representatives work as our sample, and the registered voters is the population. We wonder if the sample is representative of the general population. If yes, the sample should looks like the population, and sample distribution should conform to the population distribution.\nHere is the question: “If the individuals are randomly selected to serve on a jury, about how many of the 275 people would we expect to be white? How about black?” We ask this question because we want to know how the jury distribution looks like if the distribution does follow the distribution of the registered voters. If what we expect to see is far from what we observe, then the jury is probably not randomly sampled from the registered voters. This matches our testing rationale. We do the testing under the null hypothesis, the scenario that the observed frequency distribution fits or conforms to some claim distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite\nBlack\nHispanic\nAsian\n\n\nRegistered voters\n0.72\n0.07\n0.12\n0.09\n\n\nAccording to the claimed distribution, \\(72\\%\\) of the population is white, so we would expect about \\(72\\%\\) of the jurors to be white. In other words, we expect to see \\(0.72 \\times 275 = 198\\) white jurors in the sample of 275 jury members. We expect about \\(7\\%\\) of the jurors to be black. This corresponds to about \\(0.07 \\times 275 = 19.25\\) black jurors in the sample. The table below shows the observed count and the expected count if members are randomly selected for each ethnic group. In general, the expected count of a category is the total count times the proportion or probability of the category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite\nBlack\nHispanic\nAsian\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nObserved Count \\(O_i\\)\n\n205\n26\n25\n19\n275\n\n\n\nExpected Count \\(E_i\\)\n\n198\n19.25\n33\n24.75\n275\n\n\nPopulation Proportion \\((H_0)\\)\n\n0.72\n0.07\n0.12\n0.09\n1.00\n\n\n\nWhile some sampling variation is expected, the observed count and expected count should be similar if there was no bias in selecting the members of the jury. But how similar is similar enough? We want to test whether the differences are strong enough to provide convincing evidence that the jurors were not selected from a random sample of all registered voters.\n Goodness-of-Fit Test Example \nBefore we introduce the test procedure, to have better performance the goodness-of-fit test requires each expected count is as least five. The higher the better.\nIn words, our hypotheses are  \\[\\begin{align} &H_0: \\text{No racial bias in who serves on a jury, and } \\\\ &H_1: \\text{There is racial bias in juror selection} \\end{align}\\] \nIf the true racial distribution of juries is \\((\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3, \\pi_4)\\), where\n\n\n\\(\\pi_1\\) is the proportion of White in jury\n\n\\(\\pi_2\\) is the proportion of Black in jury\n\n\\(\\pi_3\\) is the proportion of Hispanic in jury\n\n\\(\\pi_4\\) is the proportion of Asian in jury\n\nwe want to know if the distribution conforms to the claim racial distribution of register voters \\((\\pi_1^0, \\pi_2^0, \\pi_3^0, \\pi_4^0) = (0.72, 0.07, 0.12, 0.09)\\) where\n\n\n\\(\\pi_1^0\\) is the proportion of White in register voters\n\n\\(\\pi_2^0\\) is the proportion of Black in register voters\n\n\\(\\pi_3^0\\) is the proportion of Hispanic in register voters\n\n\\(\\pi_4^0\\) is the proportion of Asian in register voters\n\nIn general, we can rewrite our hypotheses in mathematical notations:  \\[\\begin{align} &H_0: \\pi_1 = \\pi_1^0,  \\pi_2 = \\pi_2^0, \\dots, \\pi_k = \\pi_k^0\\\\ &H_1: \\pi_i \\ne \\pi_i^0 \\text{ for some } i \\end{align}\\] \nNote that \\(H_1\\) is not \\(\\pi_i \\ne \\pi_i^0 \\text{ for all } i\\). As long as one \\(\\pi_i \\ne \\pi_i^0\\) holds, the \\(H_0\\) statement is not true.\nThe test statistic is a chi-squared statistic from the chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom \\(k-1\\). Under \\(H_0\\), the test statistic is\n \\[\\chi^2_{test} = \\frac{(O_1 - E_1)^2}{E_1} + \\frac{(O_2 - E_2)^2}{E_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{(O_k - E_k)^2}{E_k},\\] where \\(O_i\\) is the observed count of the \\(i\\)-th category, and \\(E_i = n\\pi_i^0\\) is the expected count of the \\(i\\)-th category, \\(i = 1, \\dots, k.\\) \nThe goodness-of-fit test is a chi-squared test that is always right-tailed. So we reject \\(H_0\\) if  \\(\\chi^2_{test} > \\chi^2_{\\alpha, k-1}\\).  Look at the test statistic formula carefully. When will the test statistic be large or the evidence be strong? The numerator term \\((O_i-E_i)^2\\) is the squared distance between the observed and expected counts. When the two are farther away from each other, the test statistic or evidence will be stronger. As a result, when the observed count distribution is more inconsistent with the distribution we expect to see, it is more likely to conclude that the sample is not randomly drawn from the claim or assumed population distribution.\nBack to our example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite\nBlack\nHispanic\nAsian\n\n\n\nObserved Count\n\\(O_1 = 205\\)\n\\(O_2 = 26\\)\n\\(O_3 = 25\\)\n\\(O_4 = 19\\)\n\n\nExpected Count\n\\(E_1 = 198\\)\n\\(E_2 = 19.25\\)\n\\(E_3 = 33\\)\n\\(E_4 = 24.75\\)\n\n\nProportion under \\(H_0\\)\n\n\\(\\pi_1^0 = 0.72\\)\n\\(\\pi_2^0 = 0.07\\)\n\\(\\pi_3^0 = 0.12\\)\n\\(\\pi_4^0 = 0.09\\)\n\n\n\nUnder \\(H_0\\), \\(\\chi^2_{test} = \\frac{(205 - 198)^2}{198} + \\frac{(26 - 19.25)^2}{19.25} + \\frac{(25 - 33)^2}{33} + \\frac{(19 - 24.75)^2}{24.75} = 5.89\\).\nWith \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), \\(\\chi^2_{0.05, 3} = 7.81\\). Because \\(5.89 < 7.81\\), we fail to reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_1\\). Therefore, we do not have convincing evidence of racial bias in the juror selection process.\n Goodness-of-Fit Test in R \nBelow is an example of how to perform a goodness-of-fit test in R. Because the goodness-of-fit test is a chi-squared test, we use the function chisq.test(). The argument x is the observed count vector of length \\(k\\), and the argument p is the hypothesized proportion distribution which is a vector of probabilities of the same length as x. The function does not provide the critical value, but it gives us the \\(p\\)-value. Since the \\(p\\)-value is greater than \\(0.05\\), we do not reject \\(H_0\\).\n\nobs <- c(205, 26, 25, 19)\npi_0 <- c(0.72, 0.07, 0.12, 0.09)\n\n## Use chisq.test() function\nchisq.test(x = obs, p = pi_0)\n\n\n    Chi-squared test for given probabilities\n\ndata:  obs\nX-squared = 5.8896, df = 3, p-value = 0.1171\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe chi-squared test can be used in two-sided one-sample proportion test. Suppose we are doing the following test\n\\[\\begin{align} &H_0: \\pi_1 = 0.5,  \\pi_2 = 0.5 \\\\ &H_1: \\pi_i \\ne 0.5 \\text{ for some } i \\end{align}\\]\nBecause there are only two categories, we automatically know the value of \\(\\pi_2\\) when we know the value of \\(\\pi_1\\) as \\(\\pi_2 = 1 - \\pi_1\\). So the hypothesis can be reduced to\n\\[\\begin{align} &H_0: \\pi_1 = 0.5 \\\\ &H_1: \\pi_1 \\ne 0.5 \\end{align}\\] or even\n\\[\\begin{align} &H_0: \\pi = 0.5 \\\\ &H_1: \\pi \\ne 0.5 \\end{align}\\] when we use \\(\\pi\\) for the proportion of the first category and \\(1-\\pi\\) for the second. We just transform a chi-squared test setting into a two-sided one-sample proportion test setting!\nSuppose \\(n = 1000\\), \\(O_1 = 520\\), \\(O_2 = 480\\), \\(\\pi_1^0 = \\pi_2^0 = 0.5\\). Our chi-squared test is\n\n\n\n    Chi-squared test for given probabilities\n\ndata:  c(520, 480)\nX-squared = 1.6, df = 1, p-value = 0.2059\n\n\nIn the language of the one-sample proportion test, we have \\(n = 1000\\), \\(y = 520\\), \\(\\pi^0 = 0.5\\). \\((y = O_1 = 520, n-y = O_2 = 480)\\)\n\n\n\n    1-sample proportions test without continuity correction\n\ndata:  520 out of 1000, null probability 0.5\nX-squared = 1.6, df = 1, p-value = 0.2059\nalternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.4890177 0.5508292\nsample estimates:\n   p \n0.52 \n\n\nDo you see the two tests are equivalent? They have the same test statistic, degrees of freedom as well as \\(p\\)-value. Both lead to the same conclusion."
