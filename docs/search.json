This book serves as a main reference book for my MATH 4720 Statistical Methods and MATH 4740 Biostatistical Methods at Marquette University.1 Some topics can also be discussed in an introductory data science course. You’ll learn basic probability and statistical concepts as well as data analysis techniques such as linear regression using R computing software. The book balances the following aspects of statistics:\n\nmathematical expression and computation\ndistribution-based and simulation-based inferences\nmethodology and applications\nclassical/frequentist and Bayesian approaches"

    "text": "This chapter provides a broad overview of the R language that will get you programming right away. In it, you will build a pair of virtual dice that you can use to generate random numbers. Don’t worry if you’ve never programmed before; the chapter will teach you everything you need to know.\nTo simulate a pair of dice, you will have to distill each die into its essential features. You cannot place a physical object, like a die, into a computer (well, not without unscrewing some screws), but you can save information about the object in your computer’s memory.\nWhich information should you save? In general, a die has six important pieces of information: when you roll a die, it can only result in one of six numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. You can capture the essential characteristics of a die by saving the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 as a group of values in your computer’s memory.\nLet’s work on saving these numbers first, and then consider a method for “rolling” our die."
