The U.S.? The world? üò± üò± üò±\n\n\n\n\nThe solution to this problem is sampling.\nA sample is a subset of cases selected from a population.\nWe are not able to collect the average GPA of every member of the population, but we can collect a sample from that population which has fewer objects (Figure¬†13.1).\nWe can then compute the average GPA of the sample data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2.2: Sampling from the population reduces the number of objects from which to collect data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur hope is that the average GPA of the sample is close to the average GPA of the population, which is our main interest.\nFor the sample‚Äôs average GPA to be close to population‚Äôs average GPA, we want the sample to look like the population such that they share similar attributes including GPA.\n\n\n Good Sample vs.¬†Bad Sample \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this 4720/5720 class a sample of the target population Marquette students?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2.3: Majors of students in this 4740/5740 class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this 4720/5720 class a ‚Äúgood‚Äù sample of the target population?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sample is convenient to be collected, but as Figure¬†2.3 shows, it is NOT representative of the population.\nBecause this class is primarily composed of STEM majors, it may not share the attributes necessary with the target population for the two to share a similar average GPA.\nTherefore, we call this a biased sample.\n\nThe average GPA of the class may differ greatly from the average GPA of all MU undergrads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2.4: Sampling from a class of mostly STEM students is not representative of the entire population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure¬†2.5, the average GPA differs based on students‚Äô majors.\nBecause this class consists of mostly STEM majors, it is likely that the average GPA of its students is not the same as the average GPA of all MU undergraduates.\n\nFigure¬†2.4 depicts that sampling needs to be done appropriately to ensure the sample is representative of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2.5: UC Berkeley average GPAs by major\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How do we collect and why do we need a representative sample? \n\nWe always seek to randomly select a sample from a population.\nRandom sampling usually give us a representative sample, as long as the sample size, or the number of objects in the sample, is not too small.\nIt is important to collect samples this way, because many statistical methods are based on the randomness assumption."

    "text": "2.3 Data Collection\n Two Types of Studies to Collect Sample Data \n\nThere are two types of studies that are used to collect data: observational studies and experimental studies.\nAn observational study is a study in which those collecting the data observe and measure characteristics/variables, but do NOT attempt to modify or intervene with the subjects being studied.\n\n Example: Sample from 1Ô∏è‚É£ the heart disease and 2Ô∏è‚É£ heart disease-free populations and record the fat content of the diets for the two groups. \n\n\nIn an experimental study, some treatment(s) is applied and then those collecting data proceed to observe its responses or effects on the individuals (experimental units).\n\n Example: Assign volunteers to one of several diets with different levels of dietary fat (treatments) and compare the treatments with respect to the incidence of heart disease after a period of time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservational or Experimental?\n\n\n\n\nRandomly select 40 males and 40 females to see the difference in blood pressure levels between male and female.\nTest the effects of a new drug by randomly dividing patients into 3 groups (high dosage, low dosage, placebo).\n\n\n\n Limitation of Observational Studies: Confounding Variables \n\nA confounder is a variable NOT included in a study that affects the variables in the study.\nFor example, a person observes past data that shows that increases in ice cream sales are associated with increases in drownings and concludes that eating ice cream causes drownings. üò±üòï‚ÅâÔ∏è\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the confounder that is not in the data but affects ice cream sales and the number of drownings?\n\n\n\n\nTemperature\n\n\n\n\nAs temperature increases, ice cream sales increase and the number of drownings also rises because more people go swimming (Figure¬†2.6).\n\n Causal Relationships \n\nMaking causal conclusions based on experimental data is often more reasonable than making the same causal conclusions based on observational data.\nObservational studies are generally only sufficient to show associations, not causality.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2.6: Temperature acting as a confounder\n\n\n\n\n\n Types of Random Samples \n\nAs previously mentioned, many statistical methods are based on the randomness assumption.\nTherefore, it‚Äôs important to understand what a random sample is and how to collect it.\nIn a random sample, each member of a population is equally likely to be selected.\n\n Simple Random Sample \n\nFor a simple random sample (SRS), every possible sample of sample size \\(n\\) has the same chance to be chosen.\n\nExample: If I were to sample 100 students from all 10,000 Marquette students, I would randomly assign each student a number (from 1 to 10,000) and then randomly select 100 numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2.7: Simple Random Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2.8: Simple random sample from a population of 15 (https://research-methodology.net/sampling-in-primary-data-collection/random-sampling/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Stratified Random Sample \n\nFor stratified sampling, subdivide the population into different subgroups (strata) that share the same characteristics, then draw a simple random sample from each subgroup.\n\nHomogeneous within strata; Non-homogeneous between strata (Figure¬†2.9)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2.9: Stratified Sampling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Divide Marquette students into groups by colleges, then perform a SRS for each group (Figure¬†2.10).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2.10: Stratified sampling of Marquette Students\n\n\n\n\n Cluster Sampling \n\nFor cluster sampling, divide the population into clusters, then randomly select some of those clusters, and then choose all the members from those selected clusters.\n\nHomogeneous between clusters; Non-homogeneous within clusters (Figure¬†2.11)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2.11: Cluster Sampling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Study 4720 students‚Äô drinking habits by dividing the students into 9 groups, and then randomly selecting 3 and interviewing all of the students in each of those clusters (Figure¬†2.12).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2.12: Cluster sampling of Marquette students"

Figure¬†6.1 shows the Google search result of ‚Äúwhat are chances‚Äù on my personal computer on September 19, 2022. It looks like people are curious about getting pregnant, getting COVID of course at that time, and getting struck by lightning or tornado. And of course, it is the chance or uncertainty that makes so many games so fun, amusing and even additive, for example, the board game monopoly, and the gambling machines like slots and blackjacks.\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6.1: Google search result of ‚Äúwhat are chances‚Äù.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6.2: Monopoly baord game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6.3: Slots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6.4: Blackjacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApparently most people want to quantify uncertainty about something happening, or measure the chances of some event happening for better decision making. The question is, how? We need a consistent way of measuring chances and uncertainty so that our society can be operated in order. Thanks to great enthusiasm for gambling, the mathematical study of chances starts quite early, and nowadays, the most formal and rigorous way of studying chances is to use probability. Therefore, we could probably view probability as the language of uncertainty.\nMost of the time, we cannot do statistical inference or prediction using machine learning without probability because we usually assume our data at hand are random realizations from some targeted population that are described by a probability distribution. In other words, we are doing data analysis in the world of uncertainty. For example, we are interested in the mean height of Marquette female students, which is usually assumed to be bell-shaped distributed. By chances, our collected sample of girls may all have heights below 5‚Äô4‚Äù, which is not representative of the target population, and the sample mean is far from the true population mean height being interested. Examining the chance of getting such biased data set becomes important and helps us quantify the plausibility of the numerical results we obtain from the data.\nAs a result, before jumping into statistical inference or data analysis, we need to have basic understanding of probability definitions, rules, and operations that are frequently used in the data science community.\n\n Why Probability Before Statistics? \nAlthough probability and statistics are closely related and usually taught in one single introductory course, they are two distinct subjects. Since the randomness of sampling from the target population, statistical inference and data analysis usually involve uncertainty quantification, and hence probability is used in the analysis.\nIn a typical statistical analysis, we assume the target population, for example the Marquette students‚Äô height follows some probability distribution, and the collected sample data are the realized data points from the distribution. With this, the population probability distribution is a mechanism that generates data. In probability theory, we examine how this mechanism generates data, and how the observed data will behave given the fact that they are from the probabilistic data generating process. For example, we assume the height follows some probability distribution, and we are curious about the probability that the sample mean is larger than 5‚Äô10‚Äù, or that the sample mean is between 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 5‚Äô11‚Äù.\nIn the probability theory, the process generating the data is assumed known and we are interested in properties of observations. However, in reality, the data generating process, or the target population distribution, is unknown to us, and is what we would like to infer to using the sample data we collect. For example, we want to estimate the unknown mean height of Marquette students using the data of 100 Marquette students sampled at random from the unknown target population distribution. This is what statistical inference is all about. For statistics, we observe the data (sample) and are interested in determining what process generates such data (population). These principles are illustrated below in Figure¬†6.5.\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6.5: Relationship between probability and statistical inference\n\n\n\n\nEven though the data generating process is fixed and unchanged every time a data set is collected, the data replicates are all different due to the random sampling from the population probability distribution. Such randomness creates the uncertainty about how we do the inference about the population properties because a different data set represents only a part of, and probably biased, information about the the whole distribution. As a result, when doing inference, we prefer probabilistic statements to deterministic statements."

    "section": "\n6.2 Interpretation of Probability",
    "text": "6.2 Interpretation of Probability\n Relative Frequency \nThere are several ways of interpreting probability. The first interpretation is relative frequency. Formally speaking, the probability that some outcome of a process will be obtained is interpreted as the relative frequency with which that outcome would be obtained if the process were repeated a large number of times independently under similar conditions.\nThink about the following scenario. Your mom gave you a unfair coin, but she does not know the probability of getting heads when one tosses the coin. How do you obtain, or at least approximate the probability? Well, we can use the concept of relative frequency. First, we decide how many times we want to flip the coin. Each time after flipping the coin, we record either heads or tails shows up. Once we are done all the flips, we count the frequency or the total number of times heads shows up among all the flips. To obtain the probability of getting heads, we calculate the relative frequency, the ratio of the frequency of heads to the number of tosses.\nBelow is an example depicting the relative frequency of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails.\n\n\n\n\n      Frequency Relative Frequency\nHeads         4                0.4\nTails         6                0.6\nTotal        10                1.0\n---------------------\n      Frequency Relative Frequency\nHeads       514              0.514\nTails       486              0.486\nTotal      1000              1.000\n---------------------\n\n\n\n\nWhen we flip the coin 10 times, 4 of them end up being heads, and the probability of getting heads is 40%. You may be skeptical of the result, and want to have more replicates. Some day you have lots of spare time, and you decide to flip the coin 1000 times. The relative frequency, or the probability of getting heads, now becomes 51.4%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you see any issues with relative frequency probability?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApparently, we don‚Äôt know the true probability if it does exist. And as you learned in the coin-flipping example, we don‚Äôt have one unique answer for that if we use relative frequency as the way of interpreting probability. In fact, there are some issues when we treat relative frequency as probability.\n Issues with Relative Frequency \n\nüòï How large of a number is large enough?\n\nThere is no correct answer for how many replicates of the experiment we should have. We may think 10 times is not enough, but how about 1000 times? one million times? How well the relative frequency approximates the true probability depends on the complexity of the experiments. In general, the larger the number of times of repeating the process, the better the approximation of the relative frequency. This is the result of the so-called law of large numbers that is discussed in Chapter¬†12.\n\nüòï What is the meaning of ‚Äúunder similar conditions‚Äù?\n\nIn the definition, the experiment or process needs to be repeated ‚Äúunder similar conditions‚Äù. What does that mean? The definition itself is not rigorous enough. Do we need to control the airflow when the experiment is conducted? How about temperature? Can your mom and you take turns to flip the coin? Be honest, there is no answer for that.\n\nüòï Is the relative frequency reliable under identical conditions?\n\nCan we trust the relative frequency when the experiment is conducted under identical conditions? If there is a skilled person who can control whether heads or tails shows up every time he flips a coin, should we believe the relative frequency is a good approximation to the true probability?\n\nüëâ We can only obtain an approximation instead of exact value for the probability.\n\nYou may already find out that the relative frequency is only an approximation instead of exact value for the probability. If we want to get the true probability (if it does exist), we need to get the relative frequency whose process is repeated infinitely many of times, which is unrealistic. Such probability stems from the frequentist philosophy that interprets probability as the long-run relative frequency of a repeatable experiment.\n\nüòÇ How do you compute the probability that Chicago Cubs win the World Series next year?\n\nIn the real world and our daily lives, lots of times we want to compute the probability of something happening where the something cannot be a repeatable process or experiment. For example, it is impossible to compute the probability that Chicago Cubs win the World Series next year because we would never to able to obtain the relative frequency of Chicago Cubs winning the World Series next year.\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://media.giphy.com/media/EKURBxKKkw0uY/giphy.gif\n\n\n\n\n\n Classical Approach \nAnother interpretation of probability follows the classical approach, whose probability is based on the concept of equally likely outcomes. If the outcome of some process must be one of \\(n\\) different outcomes, the probability of each outcome is simply \\(1/n\\). For example, if you toss a fair coin (2 outcomes) ü™ô, the probability of getting heads is 1/2. If you roll a well-balanced die (6 outcomes) üé≤, the probability of each outcome being shown is 1/6. If you draw one from a deck of cards (52 outcomes) üÉè, the probability of each card being drawn is 1/52.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you see any issues with classical probability?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wouldn‚Äôt make sense to say that the probability that [you name it] wins the World Series next year is 1/30. Even though there are 30 teams in the MLB, each team is not equally likely to win the World Series. Don‚Äôt you agree?!\n\n Subjective Approach \nThe last interpretation of probability we discuss here is the subjective approach, whose probability is assigned or estimated using people‚Äôs knowledge, beliefs and information about the data generating process. In this case, it is a person‚Äôs subjective probability of an outcome, rather than the true probability of that outcome. For example, I think ‚Äúthe probability that the Milwaukee Brewers win the World Series this year is 30%‚Äù. My probability that the Milwaukee Brewers win the World Series this year is likely to be different from an ESPN analyst‚Äôs probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.nj.com/yankees/2020/02/mlb-rumors-espns-sunday-night-baseball-will-feature-a-lot-of-ex-yankee-alex-rodriguez-and-not-much-else.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Wiki: ESPN Major League Baseball\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, a probability measures the relative plausibility of some event or outcome, and such probability stems from the so-called Bayesian philosophy. With this, we can claim that candidate A has a 0.9 probability of winning because the probability represents our plausibility or belief about the winning chance of the candidate A. A Bayesian statistician would say based on analysis the candidate A is 9 times more likely to win than to lose. For a statistician with the frequentist philosophy, he might say the statement is wrong or there is no such claim. Or he might weirdly say in long-run hypothetical repetitions of the election, candidate A would win roughly 90% of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nProbability operations and rules do NOT depend on the interpretation of probability!"

    "section": "\n7.1 Probability Operations and Rules",
    "text": "7.1 Probability Operations and Rules\n Experiments, Events and Sample Space \nProbability starts with the concept of sets. When we calculate the probability of ‚Äúsomething‚Äù, that something is represented as a set, which is a collection of some outcomes generated by an process or experiment associated to the something we are interested. To denote a set, we usually use a pair of curly braces { }, and the elements of the set is put inside the braces, each separated by a comma, for example, {red, green, yellow} is a set with three color elements.\nHere we define some terminology that are commonly used in set and probability concepts.\n\nAn experiment is any process in which the possible outcomes can be identified ahead of time.\n\nThe key words is ahead of time. For example, we know what is the result of flipping a coin, which is heads or tails showing up, before we actually do it. Therefore, flipping a coin is an experiment. Similarly, before we roll a six-sided die, we already know the possible outcome of doing that, which is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, so rolling a die is also an experiment.\n\nAn event is a set of possible outcomes of the experiment.\n\nGenerally there are two or more potential outcomes for some experiment. Any collection of those outcomes is called an event. For example, there are 6 possible outcomes for rolling a die, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Then any collection of those 6 numbers is an event. So ‚ÄúAn odd number showing up‚Äù which corresponds to the collection {1, 3, 5} is an event. ‚ÄúAn even number showing up‚Äù that is represented by {2, 4, 6} is also an event.\n\nThe sample space \\((\\mathcal{S})\\) of an experiment is the collection of ALL possible outcomes of the experiment.\n\nBased on the definition, the sample space the largest set associated with an experiment because it collects all possible outcomes. In other words, when an experiment is conducted, no matter what outcome shows up, it is always in the sample space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the sample space also an event?\n\n\n\n\nYes, the sample space itself is an event because it is also a set of possible outcomes of the experiment.\n\n\n\nThe table below provides a summary of experiments flipping a coin and rolling a die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\nPossible Outcomes\nSome Events\nSample Space\n\n\n\nFlip a coin ü™ô\nHeads, Tails\n{Heads}, {Heads, Tails}, ‚Ä¶\n{Heads, Tails}\n\n\nRoll a die üé≤\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n{1, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 6}, {2}, {3, 4, 5, 6}, ‚Ä¶\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n\n\n\n\n Set Concept: Example of Rolling a six-side balanced die\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDraw a Venn Diagram every time you get stuck! Venn diagram is a very useful tool for identifying a set, so I encourage you to draw a venn diagram when you get stuck on complicated set operations.\n\n\n\n\n The complement  of an event (set) \\(A\\), is denoted  \\(A^c\\) . It is the set of all outcomes (elements) of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) in which \\(A\\) does not occur. For the die example, let \\(A\\) be an event that a number greater than 2 is rolled. Then \\(A = \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) and \\(A^c = \\{1, 2\\}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  union \\((A \\cup B)\\)  is the set of all outcomes of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) in \\(A\\) or \\(B\\).  For the die example, let \\(B\\) be an event that an even number is rolled. Then \\(B = \\{2, 4, 6\\}\\) and \\(A \\cup B = \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).  Basically, as long as an element is in either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\), not necessarily in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the element is collected in the set \\((A \\cup B)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  intersection \\((A \\cap B)\\)  is the set of all outcomes of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).  For the die example, \\(A \\cap B = \\{4, 6\\}\\). Basically, for any element in the set \\((A \\cap B)\\), it must be an element of \\(A\\) and of \\(B\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint or mutually exclusive if they have no outcomes in common \\((A \\cap B = \\emptyset)\\). \\(\\emptyset\\) means an empty set, \\(\\{\\}\\), i.e., no elements in the set. If the two events are disjoint, it means that they cannot occur at the same time for one single trial of the experiment.  For the die example, let \\(C\\) be an event that an odd number is obtained. Then \\(C = \\{1, 3, 5\\}\\) and \\(B \\cap C = \\emptyset\\).  When we roll a die one time, we cannot get a number that is odd and even at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe containment \\((A \\subset B)\\) means every elements of \\(A\\) also belongs to \\(B\\). In other words, if \\(A\\) occurs, then so does \\(B\\).  For the die example, let \\(B\\) be the event that an even number is obtained and \\(D\\) be the event that a number greater than 1 is obtained. Then \\(B = \\{2, 4, 6\\}\\) and \\(D = \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).  In this case, every even number is greater than one, therefore \\(B\\) is a subset of \\(D\\), i.e., \\(B \\subset D\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that every event (set) being considered is a subset of the sample space \\((\\mathcal{S})\\) because it only makes sense to discuss the events that are possibly to be occurred. As a result, for any event \\(A\\), \\(A \\subset \\mathcal{S}\\).\n\n\n\n Probability Rules \nWe have learned how to represent an event in terms of sets and set operations. Here we are going to learn several probability rules for events.\nFirst, we denote the probability of an event \\(A\\) on a sample space \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) as \\(P(A)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTreat the probability of an event as the area of the event in the Venn diagram.\n\n\nIn order to have a coherent and logically consistent set of probability rules, we need some axioms that are self-evident to anyone. The three axioms are as follows.\n\n\\(P(\\mathcal{S}) = 1\\)\nFor any event \\(A\\), \\(P(A) \\ge 0\\)\n\nIf \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint or mutually exclusive, \\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\\)\n\n\nIf we treat the sample space as an event, the probability of the entire sample space is always equal to one because this event must happen every time the experiment is conducted. In the Venn diagram, the sample space is the entire rectangle, and in probability, we presume the area of the rectangle is one.\nBecause any event is a collection of some outcomes that could possibly occur or not occur, its probability is greater than or equal to zero. Any probability cannot be negative. It is clearly shown in terms of Venn diagram because an area of any shape of an object is greater than or equal to zero.\nFinally, if the two events are disjoint, the probability of the union of the two is just the sum of their own probability. For example, if the probability of getting a green M&M is 20% and that of getting a blue M&M is 15%, then the probability of getting a green or blue M&M is 20% + 15% = 35%. It is clearly shown in the Venn diagram too because the total area of the two disjoint events in the sample space is the sum of the individual area.\nWith the three axioms, the entire probability operation system can be constructed. Some basic properties are listed here.\n\n\n\\(P(\\emptyset) = 0\\).\n\\(0 \\le P(A) \\le 1\\)\n\nAddition Rule: \\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\\)\n\n\\(P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)\\)\nIf \\(A \\subset B\\), then \\(P(A) \\le P(B)\\)\n\n\nThe empty set does not contain any possible outcomes of an experiment. Because some outcome must be occurred after an experiment is conducted, it is impossible for some event to happen without any outcome involved. Therefore, the probability of the empty set is zero. In terms of Venn diagram, an empty set is a set with area zero because it does not occupy any part (outcome) of the entire sample space.\nSince every event being considered must be a subset of the sample space, the area of any event is smaller than the area of the sample space which is one. Therefore, for any event \\(A\\), \\(P(A) \\le 1\\). \\(P(A) = 1\\) if and only if \\(A = \\mathcal{S}\\).\n\n\nThe addition rule can be clearly understood using the Venn diagram. Figure¬†7.1 shows how \\(P(A \\cup B)\\) is expressed by \\(P(A)\\), \\(P(B)\\) and \\(P(A \\cap B)\\). To get the area of \\(A \\cup B\\), we can first consider the sum of the area of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the left and right circles. However, the middle part which is \\(A \\cap B\\) is counted twice when we take the sum, so the one piece of area of \\(A \\cap B\\) should be removed from the sum of the area.\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7.1: Venn Diagram depiction of the addition rule\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the third axiom is a special case of the addition rule. Figure¬†7.2 illustrates the case. Since the two events are disjoint, \\(A \\cap B = \\emptyset\\), and the area of \\(A \\cap B\\), or \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) is zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7.2: Venn Diagram depiction of the addition rule for the disjoint case\n\n\n\n\nSince \\(A \\cup A^c = \\mathcal{S}\\) and \\(A \\cap A^c = \\emptyset\\), we have \\[P(A \\cup A^c) = P(\\mathcal{S}) = P(A) + P(A^c)\\] Therefore, \\(P(A) + P(A^c) = 1\\) and \\(P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)\\).\nIf \\(A \\subset B\\), the area of \\(A\\) is smaller or equal to the area of \\(B\\). Therefore, \\(P(A) \\le P(B)\\).\n Example: M&M Colors\n\nThe makers of the M&Ms report that their plain M&Ms are composed of\n\n15% Yellow, 10% Red, 20% Orange, 25% Blue, 15% Green and 15% Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Unsplash: Robert Anasch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you randomly select an M&M, what is the probability of the following?\n\n\n\n\nIt is brown.\nIt is red or green.\nIt is not blue.\nIt is red and brown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\\(P(\\mathrm{Brown}) = 0.15\\)\n\\(\\begin{align} P(\\mathrm{Red} \\cup \\mathrm{Green}) &= P(\\mathrm{Red}) + P(\\mathrm{Green}) - P(\\mathrm{Red} \\cap \\mathrm{Green}) \\\\ &= 0.10 + 0.15 - 0 = 0.25 \\end{align}\\)\n\\(P(\\text{Not Blue}) = 1 - P(\\text{Blue}) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75\\)\n\\(P(\\text{Red and Brown}) = P(\\emptyset) = 0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich interpretation of probability is used in this question?"

    "text": "7.2 Conditional Probability and Independence\n Conditional Probability \nQuite often people are interested in the probability of something happening given the fact that some other event has been occurred or some information about the experiment or its outcomes have been known. In this case, we can calculate the conditional probability that takes the occurred event or known information into account. The conditional probability would be more appropriate for quantifying uncertainty about what we are interested because knowing some event being occurred is a piece of valuable information that helps us properly adjust the chance of something happening.\nBy definition, the conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\) is \\[ P(A \\mid  B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}.\\]\nThe vertical bar ‚Äú\\(\\mid\\)‚Äù is read as given or conditional on. Therefore, we consider the event \\(A\\) not in the entire sample space, but the event \\(A\\) that is conditional on the event \\(B\\), or \\(A \\mid B\\). In other words, we don‚Äôt consider all possible parts of \\(A\\). Instead, we only care about the part of \\(A\\) for which \\(B\\) has already occurred.\nThe formula is well defined when \\(P(B) > 0\\) and undefined if \\(P(B) = 0\\). Intuitively, one cannot calculate the probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\) when \\(B\\) is not occurred by any chance. Figure¬†7.3 illustrates the conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\) using the Venn diagram. When we compute the probability of \\(A\\), the information about \\(B\\) have been given, and the probability of \\(A\\) is adjusted, according to this information. The conditional probability is the ratio of \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) to \\(P(B)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7.3: Venn Diagram illustration of the conditional probability of A given B\n\n\n\n\nSo what is the difference between \\(P(A)\\) and \\(P(A \\mid B)\\)? How knowing event \\(B\\) occurred affects the probability of \\(A\\)? Well, Figure¬†7.4 describes the difference. When we calculate \\(P(A)\\), we assume we don‚Äôt have any specific information at hand. What we can base on is the entire sample space because we need to take all possible outcomes into account, and see if any outcome is related to the event \\(A\\). Therefore, although we just write \\(P(A)\\), the probability is actually calculated conditional on the entire sample space, i.e., \\(P(A \\mid \\mathcal{S})\\), which is the ratio of area of \\(A\\) to the area of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) that is one. Such probability is usually called unconditional or marginal probability because being conditional on \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is like being not conditional on some specific event, and ‚Äúmarginal‚Äù means all other possible events or outcomes have been ‚Äúmarginalized‚Äù out, and only event \\(A\\) is of our interest.\nNow if we know \\(B\\) has occurred, we don‚Äôt need to consider the entire sample space any more. Instead, we can focus only on \\(B\\) since we know \\(B\\) has occurred, and anything not related to \\(B\\), or \\(B^c\\) becomes irrelevant. We shrink the search pool from \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) to the smaller space \\(B\\). To find \\(P(A \\mid B)\\), we just need to find how large part of \\(B\\) that also belongs to \\(A\\). Intuitively speaking, the event \\(B\\) has become our new sample space that are smaller than the original \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). We calculate the probability of \\(A\\) based on \\(B\\), not \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). Since \\(B\\) is the new sample space, we can treat \\(P(B)\\) as one. In other words, any probability conditional on \\(B\\) is scaled up by \\(1 / P(B)\\) so that \\(P(B) \\times \\frac{1}{P(B)} = 1\\). This is why \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) is multiplied by \\(1 / P(B)\\) in the conditional probability formula.\nHere is an example of new sample space or search pool. Suppose we would like to calculate the probability of a woman who is greater than 20 years old in a certain area. When we don‚Äôt have any background information about the woman, to compute the probability, we need to base on the entire female population of interest. But if we do know that the woman has two children, we shrink our focus on the pool of women who have two children, and compute the proportion of the women pool that is over 20 years of age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7.4: Difference Between \\(P(A)\\) and \\(P(A \\mid B)\\)\n\n\n\n\nThe conditional probability formula lead to the multiplication rule: \\[P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid  B)P(B) = P(B \\mid  A)P(A)\\] The rule is a rearranged form of the formula by multiplying both sides by \\(P(B)\\). Notice that \\(P(B \\mid A) = \\frac{P(B \\cap A)}{P(A)}\\) and hence \\(P(B \\mid A)P(A) = P(B \\cap A) = P(A \\cap B)\\).\n Example: Peanut Butter and Jelly\n\nSuppose 80% of people like peanut butter, 89% like jelly and 78% like both. Given that a randomly sampled person likes peanut butter, what is the probability that she also likes jelly?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want \\(P(J\\mid PB) = \\frac{P(PB \\cap J)}{P(PB)}\\).\nFrom the problem we have \\(P(PB) = 0.8\\), \\(P(J) = 0.89\\) and \\(P(PB \\cap J) = 0.78\\)\n\n\\(P(J\\mid PB) = \\frac{P(PB \\cap J)}{P(PB)} = \\frac{0.78}{0.8} = 0.975\\)\nIf we don‚Äôt know if the person loves peanut butter, the probability that he or she loves jelly is 89%.\nIf we do know she loves peanut butter, the probability that he or she loves jelly is going up to 97.5%.\n\n\n\n\n Independence \nIn the previous example, we learn that whether a person loves peanut butter affects the probability that she loves jelly. This piece of information is relevant, and the two events ‚Äúlove peanut butter‚Äù and ‚Äúlove jelly‚Äù are dependent each other because the one event will affect the chance of the other event happening. Uncovering the association or dependence is important for statistical inference because it helps statisticians better pin down the probability of being interest.\nFormally speaking, event \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent if \\(\\begin{align} P(A \\mid B) &= P(A) \\text{ or }\\\\ P(B \\mid A) &= P(B) \\text{ or } \\\\P(A\\cap B) &= P(A)P(B)\\end{align}\\) \\(\\text{ for } P(A) > 0 \\text{ and } P(B) > 0.\\)\nIntuitively, this means that knowing \\(B\\) occurs does not change the probability that \\(A\\) occurs and vice versa. The information about \\(B\\) is irrelevant to probability of \\(A\\).\nHere is a question. Can we compute \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) if we only know \\(P(A)\\) and \\(P(B)\\)? The answer is no. We cannot compute \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) because we don‚Äôt know if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent. We can only do so if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent. In general, we need to consider the dependence of two events and use the multiplication rule \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B)P(B)\\).\nFigure¬†7.5 explain independence using the Venn diagram. Independence means that the ratio of area of \\(A\\) to area of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is the same as the ratio of area of \\(A \\cap B\\) to area of \\(B\\). Look at the case of non-independence on the right, the two events (circles) in particular. The area of \\(A \\cap B\\) is very close to the area of \\(B\\) because the two events are quite overlapped each other. It means that the ratio of area of \\(A \\cap B\\) to area of \\(B\\) is pretty close to one. So if we know \\(B\\) has occurred, there will be a very high chance that \\(A\\) would happen as well. In this case, the information about \\(B\\) does matter, and affect probability of \\(A\\). The idea is that the two events describe pretty much similar set of outcomes for an experiment. As a result, when one occurs, we are pretty sure the other happens as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7.5: Venn Diagram Explanation of Independence\n\n\n\n\n Independence Example \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming that events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent and that \\(P(A) = 0.3\\) and \\(P(B) = 0.7\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(P(A \\cap B)\\)?\n\n\\(P(A \\cup B)\\)?\n\n\\(P(A \\mid B)\\)?\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)=0.21\\)\n\\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\\cap B) = 0.3+0.7-0.21=0.79\\)\n\\(P(A \\mid B) = P(A) = 0.3\\)"

Since \\(p\\)-value \\(= 0.317 > 0.05 = \\alpha\\), we DO NOT reject \\(H_0\\).\n\n Step 6: Restate the Conclusion in Nontechnical Terms, and Address the Original Claim \n\n There is insufficient evidence to support the claim that this week the mean price of milk is different from the price last week. \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†15.8: Illustration of Critical Value and P-Value methods\n\n\n\n\n\n Calculation in R \n\nBelow is an example of how to perform the two-tailed Z-test in R.\n\n\n## create objects to be used\nalpha <- 0.05; mu_0 <- 2.78; \nx_bar <- 2.8; sigma <- 0.1; n <- 25\n\n## Test statistic\n(z_test <- (x_bar - mu_0) / (sigma / sqrt(n))) \n\n[1] 1\n\n## Critical value\n(z_crit <- qnorm(alpha/2, lower.tail = FALSE)) \n\n[1] 1.959964\n\n## p-value\n(p_val <- 2 * pnorm(z_test, lower.tail = FALSE)) \n\n[1] 0.3173105"
