## We Focus On Statistical Inference

- We spend most of time on various *statistical methods for analyzing data*.
- Learn useful information 
  + about the **population** we are interested
  + from our **sample data**
  + through **statistical inferential** methods, including **estimation** and **testing**

## Statistics is a Science of Data, so What is Data?

- **Data**: A set of **objects** on which we observe or measure one or more **characteristics**.
- Objects are individuals, observations, subjects or cases in statistical studies.
- A characteristic or attribute is called a **variable** because it *varies* from one to another.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/mu_data_2022.png")
```







---
## Data Matrix
- Each row corresponds to a unique case or observational unit.
- Each column represents a characteristic or variable.
- This structure allows new cases to be added as rows or new variables as new columns.
```{r mu_data, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",fig.align='center'}

## Target Population
- The first step in conducting a study is to *identify questions* to be investigated.
- A clear research question is helpful in identifying

  + what *variables* are important (column)
  
- Target **Population**: The **complete** collection of data we'd like to make inference about.

## How and Why a Representative Sample?
- We always seek to **randomly** select a sample from a population.
- Lots of statistical methods are based on *randomness assumption*.

# Data Collection

---
## Two Types of Studies to Collect Sample Data

- **Observational Study**: Observe and measure characteristics/variables, and do **NOT** attempt to modify or intervene with the subjects being studied.
  + <span style="color:blue"> Sample from `r emo::ji('one')` the heart disease and `r emo::ji('two')` heart disease-free populations. Then record the fat content of the diets for the two groups.</span> </span> 

- **Experimental Study**: Apply some **treatment(s)** and then proceed to observe its responses or effects on the individuals (experimental units).
  + <span style="color:blue">Assign volunteers to one of several diets with different levels of dietary fat (treatments). Then compare the treatments with respect to the incidence of hear disease after a period of time. </span> 


--

.question[
Observational or Experimental?
- <span style="color:blue">Randomly select 40 males and 40 females to see the difference in blood pressure levels between male and female. </span> 
- <span style="color:blue"> Test the effects of a new drug by randomly dividing patients into 3 groups (high dosage, low dosage, placebo). </span> 
]




---
## Limitation of Observational Studies: Confounding

- **Confounder**: A variable NOT included in a study but affects the variables in the study.
- Observe past data show that increases in ice cream sales are associated with increases in drownings, and we conclude that **eating ice cream causes drownings**. `r emo::ji('scream')` `r emo::ji('confused')` `r emo::ji('interrobang')`
 
.pull-left[
```{r icecream, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/icecream.jpeg")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r drown, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/drowning.jpeg")
```
]

--

.question[
What is the confounder that is not in the data, but affects ice cream sales and the number of drownings?
]

--
***Temperature***: as temperature increases, ice cream sales increase and the number of drownings goes up because more people swim.
```{r beach, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width="15%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/beach.jpeg")
```









---
## Causal Relationship
- Making causal conclusions based on *experiments* is often more reasonable than making the same causal conclusions based on observational data.
- Observational studies are generally only sufficient to show **associations, not causality**.

# Sampling Methods




---
## Simple Random Sample

- **Random Sample**: Each member of a population is **equally likely** to be selected.
- **Simple Random Sample (SRS)**: Every possible sample of sample size $n$ has the same chance to be chosen.
- **Example**: If sample 100 students from all, say 10,000 Marquette students, I would *randomly* assign each student a number (from 1 to 10,000), then *randomly* select 100 numbers.

## Stratified Random Sample
- **Stratified Sampling**: Subdivide the population into different subgroups (strata) that share the **same** characteristics, then draw a simple random sample from each subgroup.
- **Homogeneous within strata; Non-homogeneous between strata**

## Cluster Sampling
- **Cluster Sampling**: Divide the population into clusters, then randomly select some of those clusters, and then choose **all** the members from those selected clusters.
- **Homogeneous between clusters; Non-homogeneous within clusters**

## Categorical vs. Numerical Variables
- A **categorical** variable provides *non-numerical* information which can be placed in **one (and only one)** category from two or more categories.

--

  + <span style="color:blue">Gender (Male  `r emo::ji('man')`, Female  `r emo::ji('woman')`,  Trans  `r emo::ji('rainbow_flag')`) </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue">Class (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Graduate) </span>
  + <span style="color:blue">Country (USA `r emo::ji('us')`, Canada `r emo::ji('canada')`, UK `r emo::ji('uk')`, Germany `r emo::ji('de')`, Japan `r emo::ji('jp')`, Korea `r emo::ji('kr')`) </span> 

--
- A **numerical** variable is recorded in a *numerical* value representing counts or measurements.

--

  + <span style="color:blue"> GPA </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue"> The number of relationships you've had </span>
  + <span style="color:blue"> Height </span> 
  


---
## Numerical Variables can be Discrete or Continuous
- A **discrete** variable takes on values of a **finite** or **countable** number. 
- A **continuous** variable takes on values **anywhere** over a particular range *without gaps or jumps*.

--

  + <span style="color:blue"> GPA is **continuous** because it can be any value between 0 and 4. </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue"> The number of relationships you've had is **discrete** because you can count the number and it is finite.</span>
  + <span style="color:blue"> Height is **continuous** because it can be any number within a range. </span> 

---
## Categorical Variables are Usually Recorded as Numbers 
  + <span style="color:blue">Gender (Male = 0, Female = 1, Trans = 2) </span>
  + <span style="color:blue">Class (Freshman = 1, Sophomore = 2, Junior = 3, Senior = 4, Graduate = 5) </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue">Country (USA = 100, Canada = 101, UK = 200, Germany = 201, Japan = 300, Korea = 301) </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue">United Airlines boarding groups</span> 

  + **The numbers represent categories only; differences between them are meaningless.**
    * Canada - USA = 101 - 100 = 1?
    * Graduate - Sophomore = 5 - 2 = 3 = Junior?
  + We need to learn the **level of measurements** to know whether or which arithmetic operations are meaningful.



  
  
---
## Levels of Measurements: Nominal and Ordinal for Categorical Variables
- **Nominal**: The data can *NOT be ordered* in a meaningful or natural way.
  + <span style="color:blue">Gender (Male = 0, Female = 1, Trans = 2) </span> is **nominal** because Male, Female and Trans cannot be ordered.
  + <span style="color:blue">Country (USA = 100, Canada = 101, UK = 200, Germany = 201, Japan = 300, Korea = 301) </span> is **nominal**.
  
<br> 

- **Ordinal**: The data can be arranged in some meaningful order, but differences between data values can NOT be determined or are meaningless.
  + <span style="color:blue">Class (Freshman = 1, Sophomore = 2, Junior = 3, Senior = 4, Graduate = 5) </span> is **ordinal** because Sophomore is one class higher than Freshman.

---
## Levels of Measurements: Interval and Ratio for Numerical Variables
- **Interval**: The data have meaningful difference between any two values. But the data do NOT have a **natural zero or starting point**. The data can do $\color{red} +$ and $\color{red} -$, but can't reasonably do $\color{red} \times$ and $\color{red} \div$. 
  + <span style="color:blue">Temperature</span> is **interval** because $80^{\circ}$F is 40 degrees higher than $40^{\circ}$F $(80-40=40)$, but $0^{\circ}$ does not mean NO heat and $80^{\circ}$F is NOT twice as hot as $40^{\circ}$F.
  
<br> 

- **Ratio**: The data have both meaningful differences and ratios, and there is a natural zero starting point that indicates none of the quantity. The data can do $\color{red} +$, $\color{red} -$,  $\color{red} \times$ and $\color{red} \div$.
  + <span style="color:blue">Distance</span> is **ratio** because $80$ miles is twice as far as $40$ miles $(80/40 = 2)$, and $0$ mile means no distance.
