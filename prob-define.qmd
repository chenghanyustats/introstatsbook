## Why Study Probability
- We live in a world full of chances and uncertainty! (Sept 19, 2022)

## Why Probability Before Statistics?
<!-- - Probability is the language of statistical inference and prediction.  -->
- <span style="color:blue"> **Probability** </span>: We *know* the process generating the data and are interested in properties of observations.
- <span style="color:blue"> **Statistics** </span>: We *observed* the data (sample) and are interested in determining what is the process generating the data (population).

                     curve = -0.2, arr.pos = 0.98)
diagram::curvedarrow(from = c(0.56, -0.47), to = c(-0.56, -0.47),

text(x = 0, y = -0.8, labels = "Statistical Inference", cex = 1.5)
```

## Interpretation of Probability: **Relative Frequency**
- <span style="color:blue"> **Relative Frequency** </span>: The probability that some outcome of a process will be obtained is interpreted as the **relative frequency** with which that outcome would be obtained _if the process were repeated **a large number of times** independently under **similar conditions**._

```{r toss_coin, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
rel_freq_head <- rep(0, 2)
times <- c(10, 1000)
for (i in 1:2) {
  x <- sample(c("Heads", "Tails"), times[i], replace = TRUE)
  freq_table <- as.matrix(table(x)); colnames(freq_table) <- "Frequency"
  rel_freq_table <- cbind(freq_table, "Relative Frequency" = freq_table[, 1] / times[i])
  rel_freq_table <- rbind(rel_freq_table, Total = apply(rel_freq_table, 2, sum))
  print(rel_freq_table)
  cat("---------------------\n")
  rel_freq_head[i] <- rel_freq_table[1, 2]
}
```
- If we repeat tossing the coin 10 times, the probability of obtaining a head is `r rel_freq_head[1] * 100`%. 
- If 1000 times, the probability is `r rel_freq_head[2] * 100`%.

## Any issue of relative frequency probability?

## Issues of **Relative Frequency**
- `r emoji('confused')` How large of a number is large enough? 

- `r emoji('confused')` Meaning of "under similar conditions"

- `r emoji('confused')` The relative frequency is reliable under identical conditions?


- `r emoji('point_right')`  We only obtain an approximation instead of exact value.

- `r emoji('joy')`  How do you compute the probability that Chicago Cubs wins the World Series next year?

## Interpretation of Probability: **Classical Approach**
- <span style="color:blue"> **Classical** probability </span>: The probability is based on the concept of **equally likely** outcomes. 
- If the outcome of some process must be one of $n$ different outcomes, the probability of each outcome is $1/n$. 


- Example: 
  + toss a fair coin (2 outcomes) p*
  + roll a well-balanced die (6 outcomes)  `r emoji('game_die')` 
  + draw one from a deck of cards (52 outcomes) `r emoji('black_joker')`

- _The probability that *[you name it]* wins the World Series next year is **1/30**_?!

```

## Interpretation of Probability: **Subjective Approach**
- <span style="color:blue"> **Subjective** probability </span>: The probability is assigned or estimated using people's **knowledge, beliefs and information** about the data generating process.

- A person's *subjective* probability of an outcome, rather than the *true* probability of that outcome.


- I think *"the probability that Milwaukee Brewers wins the World Series this year is 30%"*.

- My probability that Milwaukee Brewers wins the World Series next year is *different* from an ESPN MLB analyst's probability.
