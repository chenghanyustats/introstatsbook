## Language of Uncertainty

<span style="color:blue"> **Why Study Probability** </span>

- We live in a world full of chances and uncertainty, and probability is the language of uncertainty!
- Probability is the language of statistical inference and prediction.
- Below are a few real world examples of where probability plays a role.

<span style="color:blue"> **Why Probability Before Statistics?** </span>

- For **probability**, we *know* the process generating the data and are interested in properties of observations.
- For **statistics**, we *observe* the data (sample) and are interested in determining what process is generating the data (population).
- These principles are illustrated below in @fig-prob-stats.

## Interpretation of Probability

<span style="color:blue"> **Relative Frequency** </span>

- The probability that some outcome of a process will be obtained is interpreted as the **relative frequency** with which that outcome would be obtained _if the process were repeated **a large number of times** independently under **similar conditions**._
- Below is an example depicting the relative frequency of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails.

<center>
```{r toss_coin, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
rel_freq_head <- rep(0, 2)
times <- c(10, 1000)
for (i in 1:2) {
  x <- sample(c("Heads", "Tails"), times[i], replace = TRUE)
  freq_table <- as.matrix(table(x)); colnames(freq_table) <- "Frequency"
  rel_freq_table <- cbind(freq_table, "Relative Frequency" = freq_table[, 1] / times[i])
  rel_freq_table <- rbind(rel_freq_table, Total = apply(rel_freq_table, 2, sum))
  print(rel_freq_table)
  cat("---------------------\n")
  rel_freq_head[i] <- rel_freq_table[1, 2]
}
```
</center>

- If we flip the coin 10 times, the probability of obtaining a head is `r rel_freq_head[1] * 100`%. 
- If we flip it 1000 times, the probability is `r rel_freq_head[2] * 100`%.

## Do you see any issues with relative frequency probability?

<span style="color:red"> ***Issues with Relative Frequency*** </span>

- `r emoji('confused')` How large of a number is large enough? 
- `r emoji('confused')` What is the meaning of "under similar conditions"?
- `r emoji('confused')` Is the relative frequency reliable under identical conditions?
- `r emoji('point_right')` We can only obtain an approximation instead of exact value for the probability.
- `r emoji('joy')`  How do you compute the probability that Chicago Cubs win the World Series next year?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="color:blue"> **Classical Approach** </span>

- For the **classical approach**, the probability is based on the concept of **equally likely** outcomes. 
- If the outcome of some process must be one of $n$ different outcomes, the probability of each outcome is $1/n$. 
- Example: 
  + If you toss a fair coin (2 outcomes) ðŸª™, the probability of each is 1/2.
  + If you roll a well-balanced die (6 outcomes)  `r emoji('game_die')`, the probability of each is 1/6.
  + If you draw one from a deck of cards (52 outcomes) `r emoji('black_joker')`, the probability of each is 1/52.

## Do you see any issues with classical probability?
:::

- It wouldn't make sense to say that _the probability that *[you name it]* wins the World Series next year is **1/30**_.
  - Even thought there are 30 teams in the MLB, each team is not equally likely to win the World Series.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="color:blue">  **Subjective Approach** </span>

- For the **subjective approach**, the probability is assigned or estimated using people's **knowledge, beliefs and information** about the data generating process.
- In this case, it is a person's *subjective* probability of an outcome, rather than the *true* probability of that outcome.
- For example, I think *"the probability that the Milwaukee Brewers win the World Series this year is 30%"*.
  - My probability that the Milwaukee Brewers win the World Series this year is likely *different* from an ESPN analyst's probability.
