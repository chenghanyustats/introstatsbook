:::{layout-ncol=2}
- A town in Wisconsin has 5000 people who reach their 16th birthday, and 25 of them die before their 17th birthday.
- Many residents claim that the number is too high and suspect air pollution as a cause.
- Others suggest that the number of deaths vary from year to year, so it is no cause for concern.

## How do we objectively address this issue?
- One essential piece of information is the death rate for people in this age group, which can be extracted from a **life table**.
:::

## Life Table

- A **period life table** describes mortality and longevity data for a *hypothetical* cohort.
- The data is computed with the assumption that **the conditions affecting mortality in a particular year remain the same throughout the lives of everyone in the hypothetical cohort.**
  + For example, a 1-year-old toddler and an elderly 70-year-old live their entire life in a world with **the same constant death rates** that were present in a given year.
- An example of a life table is shown in @fig-life-table.

```

- The entire report can be downloaded at [CDC Publications and Information Products](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr69/nvsr69-12-508.pdf).
- Mortality experiences are different for various gender and race groups, so it is common to have tables for specific groups.
  - For example, @fig-female-life below is a table for females in the United States.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
#| label: fig-female-life
#| fig-cap: Life table for females in the United States in 2018

```

- The basis year for the mortality rate in this table is 2018, as is highlighted in @fig-life-mortality-people.
- This life table has data for a cohort of 100,000 *hypothetical* people.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}

#| fig-cap: The life table lists its basis year and number of hypothetical individuals
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-model/life_table_year_hypo.png")
```

- The age ranges chosen for this life table include the following classes: $[0, 1)$, $[1, 2)$, $[2, 3)$, ... $[99, 100)$, $[100, \infty)$.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
#| label: fig-age-range
#| fig-cap: The first column lists the age intervals of the individuals
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-model/life_table_age.png")
```

- The probabilities of dying **during the age interval** are listed in the 1st column of the life table.
- For example, in @fig-prob-dying, there is a 0.000367 probability of someone dying between their 1st birthday and their 2nd birthday.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-model/life_table_prob.png")
```

- The number of people alive at the **beginning** of the age interval is listed in column 2.
- As @fig-alive-beginning displays, among the 100,000 hypothetical people who were born, 99,435 of them are alive on their 1st birthday.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}

#| fig-cap: The fourth column lists the number of individuals who die during a given age interval
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-model/life_table_death.png")
```

- The total number of years lived **during** the age interval by those who were alive at the beginning of the age interval is listed in the fourth column.
- For example, the 100,000 people who were present at age 0 lived a total of 99,505 years (@fig-years-lived).
- If none of those people had died, this entry would have been 100,000 years.

#| fig-cap: The fifth column lists the total number of person-years lived within a given age interval
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-model/life_table_year_lived.png")
```

- The sixth column is similar to the fifth, but lists the total number of years lived **during the age interval and all of the following age intervals** as well.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
#| label: fig-total-years-lived
#| fig-cap: The fifth column lists the total number of person-years lived above a given age
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-model/life_table_total_year_lived.png")
```

- The final column lists the expected remaining lifetime in years, measured from the *beginning* of the age interval (@fig-remaining-life).

<span style="color:blue"> **Example: Probability of Dying** </span>

- Use @fig-life-table to find the probability of a person dying between age of 15 and 20.

$$\begin{align*} Pr(\text{die in } [15, 20)) &= Pr([15, 16) \cup [16, 17) \cup \cdots \cup [19, 20)) \\ &= Pr([15, 16) + Pr([16, 17)) + \cdots + Pr([19, 20)) \\ &= 0.000214 + 0.000253 + 0.000292 + 0.000329 + 0.000365 = 0.001453 \end{align*}$$

$$\begin{align*} Pr(\text{surviving between 15th and 20th birthdays}) &= \frac{\text{Number of people alive on their 20th birthday}}{\text{Number of people alive on their 15th birthday}} \\ &= \frac{99,151}{99,296} \\ &= 0.99854 \end{align*}$$

$$Pr(\text{die in } [15, 20)) = 1-Pr(\text{survive in } [15, 20)) = 1 - 0.99854 = 0.00146$$
