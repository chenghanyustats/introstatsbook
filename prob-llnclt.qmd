## Central Limit Theorem

- We know if $X_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ , then $\overline{X} \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n} \right)$.
  - <span style="color:blue"> But what if the population distribution is **NOT** normal? </span> 

<center>
The **central limit theorem (CLT)** gives us the answer!
</center>

<br>

- **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**: 
  - Suppose $\overline{X}$ is from a random sample of size $n$ and from a population distribution having mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma < \infty$. 
  - As $n$ increases, the sampling distribution of $\overline{X}$ looks **more and more like $N(\mu, \sigma^2/n)$ regardless of the distribution from which we are sampling!**

<span style="color:blue"> **Why is the Central Limit Theorem Important?** </span>

- Many well-developed statistical methods are based on the normal distribution assumption.
- With the Central Limit Theorem, we can use these methods even if we are sampling from a non-normal distribution or if we have no idea what the population distribution is, provided that the sample size is large enough.

## Central Limit Theorem Example
::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="75%"}
- Suppose that the selling prices of houses in Milwaukee are known to have a mean of $382,000 and a standard deviation of $150,000. 
- In 100 randomly selected sales, what is the probability the *average* selling price is more than $400,000?
- Since the sample size is fairly large $(n = 100)$, by the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the average selling price is approximately normal with a mean of $382,000 and a SD of $150,000 / \sqrt{100}$.

```
:::
::::

- $P(\overline{X} > 400000) = P\left(\frac{\overline{X} - 382000}{150000/\sqrt{100}}  > \frac{400000 - 382000}{150000/\sqrt{100}}\right) \approx P(Z > 1.2)$ where $Z \sim N(0, 1)$.

<!-- - We need the sampling distribution of the average selling price in order to obtain the probability.  -->



```{r}
pnorm(1.2, lower.tail = FALSE)
pnorm(400000, mean = 382000, sd = 150000/sqrt(100), lower.tail = FALSE)
```
