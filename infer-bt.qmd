So far we learn that 

- When the population is Gaussian, then the sampling distribution of sample mean is also Gaussian.

- When the population follows some distribution with finite mean and standard deviation, with the central limit theorem, the sampling distribution of sample mean gets closer to a Gaussian distribution as the sample size gets large.

## What if the population is not Gaussian and the sample size is small?

What will the sampling distribution of the sample mean look like? How do we construct a confidence interval without using the formula based on the normal distribution?

In this chapter we will learn the statistical computing method **bootstrapping** that quantifies the uncertainty about the unknown parameters without distribution assumptions on the population. The term bootstrapping comes from the old saying *"pull oneself up by one's bootstraps"*, meaning that one accomplishes an impossible task without others' help. In statistics, bootstrapping does not rely on any information about the target distribution or interested quantity (estimand). *It estimates a population parameter using data from only the given single sample dataset, without CI formula and replicates of data.* I call such task "impossible" task, but that's basically what statistical inference usually does.

Bootstrapping can be applied in many situations, even for large sample size. It is a very popular method in statistics and machine learning. There are numerous variants of boostrapping methods, and here we focus on the main idea of the method, and how we can apply it to construct a confidence interval for the population mean. Please read [IMS chapter 12](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/foundations-bootstrapping) for details about confidence intervals with bootstrapping.
