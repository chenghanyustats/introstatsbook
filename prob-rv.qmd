## Random Variables
- Recap: A **variable** in a data set is a characteristic that varies from one to another.

  + A variable can be either categorical or numerical.
  
  + Numerical variables can be either **discrete** or **continuous**.


- A **random variable**, usually written as $X$ <sup>1</sup>, is a variable whose possible values are **numerical** outcomes determined by **chance** or **randomness** of a procedure or experiment.

  + <span style="color:blue"> Toss a coin 2 times. $X$ = # of heads. </span> 
  
  + <span style="color:blue"> $X$ = # of accidents in W. Wisconsin Ave. per day.</span>

  <!-- + $X$ = time (in minutes) until next accident in W. Wisconsin Ave. -->

- A random variable has a **probability distribution** associated with it, accounting for its randomness. 


[1] Usually in statistics, a capital $X$ represents a random variable and a small $x$ represents a realized value of $X$.



## Discrete and Continuous Random Variables
- A **discrete** random variable takes on a **finite** or **countable** number of values.
- A **continuous** random variable has **infinitely** many values, and the collection of values is **uncountable**.
- <span style="color:blue"> The number of relationships you've ever had is **discrete** variable because we can count the number and it is finite.</span>

  + If we can further determine the probability that the number is 0, 1, 2, or any possible number, it is a **discrete random variable**.
  
- <span style="color:blue"> Height is **continuous** because it can be any number within a range. </span> 

  + If we have a way to quantify the probability that the height is from any value $a$ to any value $b$, it is a **continuous random variable**.
