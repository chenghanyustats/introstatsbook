## Data

<span style="color:blue"> **What is Data?** </span>

- Because statistics is a science of data, we first need to understand what data is.
- **Data** can be described as a set of **objects** on which we observe or measure one or more **characteristics**.
  - **Objects** are individuals, observations, subjects or cases in statistical studies.
  - A **characteristic or attribute** is also called a **variable** because it *varies* from one object to another.
- We usually store a data set in a matrix form that has rows and columns.
  - Each row corresponds to a unique case or observational unit.
  - Each column represents a characteristic or variable.
- This structure allows new cases to be added as rows or new variables to be added as columns.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="color:blue"> **Example** </span>

- @fig-marquette-data below is a data set of Marquette basketball players stored in matrix form.
- The objects are individuals or players in the data and each have their own associated row.
- Each player has several characteristics or attributes shown in the columns associated with them.
  - These include jersey number, class, position, height, weight, hometown and high school.
  - These characteristics can also be referred to as variables because they vary from one player to another.

```

## Population and Sample

<span style="color:blue"> **Target Population** </span>

- The first step in conducting a study is to *identify questions* to be investigated.
- A clear research question is helpful in identifying
  + what *cases* should be studied (row)
  + what *variables* are important (column)
- Once the research question is determined, it is important to identify the target population to be investigated.
- The **target population** is the **complete** collection of data we'd like to make inference about.

:::

:::{.column width="2%"}
:::

:::{.column width="49%"}
- <span style="color:blue"> **Target Population**: All Marquette undergraduate students that are currently enrolled.</span>
- Because all Marquette undergrads that are currently enrolled are the **complete** collection of data we'd like to make inference about, each currently enrolled Marquette undergrad is an object.
- Average GPA is the variable or population property we would like to make an inference about.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="color:blue"> **Sample Data** </span>

- In some cases it's possible to collect data of all the cases we are interested in.
- However, most of the time it is either expensive or too time consuming to collect data for every case in a population.
- What if we tried to collect data on the average GPA of **all** students in Illinois? The U.S.? The world? `r emoji('scream')` `r emoji('scream')` `r emoji('scream')`

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="49%"}
- The solution to this problem is sampling.
- A **sample** is a **subset** of cases selected from a population.
- We are not able to collect the average GPA of every member of the population, but we can collect a sample from that population which has fewer objects (@fig-sampling).
- We can then compute the average GPA of the sample data.

- The sample is convenient to be collected, but as @fig-chart shows, it is NOT **representative** of the population.
- Because this class is primarily composed of STEM majors, it may not share the attributes necessary with the target population for the two to share a similar average GPA.
- Therefore, we call this a **biased sample**.
  - The average GPA of the class may differ greatly from the average GPA of all MU undergrads.

- As shown in @fig-major-gpa, the average GPA differs based on students' majors.
- Because this class consists of mostly STEM majors, it is likely that the average GPA of its students is not the same as the average GPA of all MU undergraduates.
- @fig-biased-sample depicts that sampling needs to be done appropriately to ensure the sample is representative of the population.

<span style="color:blue"> **How do we collect and why do we need a representative sample?** </span>

- We always seek to **randomly** select a sample from a population.
- Random sampling usually give us a representative sample, as long as the sample size, or the number of objects in the sample, is not too small.
- It is important to collect samples this way, because many statistical methods are based on the *randomness assumption*.

```{r, ref.label="sample", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="75%"}

```

## Data Collection 

<span style="color:blue"> **Two Types of Studies to Collect Sample Data** </span>

- There are two types of studies that are used to collect data: observational studies and experimental studies.
- An **observational study** is a study in which those collecting the data observe and measure characteristics/variables, but do **NOT** attempt to modify or intervene with the subjects being studied.
  + <span style="color:blue"> Example: Sample from `r emoji('one')` the heart disease and `r emoji('two')` heart disease-free populations and record the fat content of the diets for the two groups. </span> 
- In an **experimental study**, some **treatment(s)** is applied and then those collecting data proceed to observe its responses or effects on the individuals (experimental units).
  + <span style="color:blue"> Example: Assign volunteers to one of several diets with different levels of dietary fat (treatments) and compare the treatments with respect to the incidence of heart disease after a period of time. </span> 


:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## Observational or Experimental? 
- Randomly select 40 males and 40 females to see the difference in blood pressure levels between male and female. 
- Test the effects of a new drug by randomly dividing patients into 3 groups (high dosage, low dosage, placebo).
:::

<span style="color:red"> ***Limitation of Observational Studies: Confounding Variables*** </span>

- A **confounder** is a variable NOT included in a study that affects the variables in the study.
- For example, a person observes past data that shows that increases in ice cream sales are associated with increases in drownings and concludes that **eating ice cream causes drownings**. 
`r emoji('scream')``r emoji('confused')``r emoji('interrobang')`

## What is the confounder that is not in the data but affects ice cream sales and the number of drownings?
- **Temperature**
:::

- As temperature increases, ice cream sales increase and the number of drownings also rises because more people go swimming (@fig-temperature).

<span style="color:red"> ***Causal Relationships*** </span>

- Making causal conclusions based on *experimental* data is often more reasonable than making the same causal conclusions based on *observational* data.
- Observational studies are generally only sufficient to show **associations, not causality**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="color:blue"> **Types of Random Samples** </span>

- As previously mentioned, many statistical methods are based on the *randomness assumption*.
- Therefore, it's important to understand what a random sample is and how to collect it.
- In a **random sample**, each member of a population is **equally likely** to be selected.

<span style="color:red"> ***Simple Random Sample*** </span>

- For a **simple random sample (SRS)**, every possible sample of sample size $n$ has the same chance to be chosen.
- **Example**: If I were to sample 100 students from all 10,000 Marquette students, I would *randomly* assign each student a number (from 1 to 10,000) and then *randomly* select 100 numbers.

<span style="color:blue"> **Categorical vs. Numerical Variables** </span>

- A **categorical** variable provides *non-numerical* information which can be placed in **one (and only one)** category from two or more categories.
  + <span style="color:blue">Gender (Male  `r emoji('man')`, Female  `r emoji('woman')`,  Trans  `r emoji('rainbow_flag')`) </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue">Class (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Graduate) </span>
  + <span style="color:blue">Country (USA `r emoji('us')`, Canada `r emoji('canada')`, UK `r emoji('uk')`, Germany `r emoji('de')`, Japan `r emoji('jp')`, Korea `r emoji('kr')`) </span> 
- A **numerical** variable is recorded in a *numerical* value representing counts or measurements.
  + <span style="color:blue"> GPA </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue"> The number of relationships you've had </span>
  + <span style="color:blue"> Height </span> 
  
<span style="color:red"> ***Numerical Variables*** </span>

- Numerical variables can be discrete or continuous.
- A **discrete** variable takes on values of a **finite** or **countable** number.
- A **continuous** variable takes on values **anywhere** over a particular range *without gaps or jumps*.
  + <span style="color:blue"> GPA is **continuous** because it can be any value between 0 and 4. </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue"> The number of relationships you've had is **discrete** because you can count the number and it is finite.</span>
  + <span style="color:blue"> Height is **continuous** because it can be any number within a range. </span> 


<span style="color:red"> ***Categorical Variables*** </span> 

- Categorical variables are usually recorded as numbers.
- <span style="color:blue">Gender (Male = 0, Female = 1, Trans = 2) </span>
- <span style="color:blue">Class (Freshman = 1, Sophomore = 2, Junior = 3, Senior = 4, Graduate = 5) </span> 
- <span style="color:blue">Country (USA = 100, Canada = 101, UK = 200, Germany = 201, Japan = 300, Korea = 301) </span> 
- <span style="color:blue">United Airlines boarding groups</span> 
- **The numbers represent categories only; differences between them are meaningless.**
    * Canada - USA = 101 - 100 = 1?
    * Graduate - Sophomore = 5 - 2 = 3 = Junior?
- We need to learn the **level of measurements** to know which arithmetic operations are meaningful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="color:blue"> **Levels of Measurements** </span>

<span style="color:red"> ***Nominal and Ordinal for Categorical Variables*** </span>

- **Nominal**: The data can *NOT be ordered* in a meaningful or natural way.
  + <span style="color:blue">Gender (Male = 0, Female = 1, Trans = 2) </span> is **nominal** because Male, Female and Trans cannot be ordered.
  + <span style="color:blue">Country (USA = 100, Canada = 101, UK = 200, Germany = 201, Japan = 300, Korea = 301) </span> is **nominal**.

- **Ordinal**: The data can be arranged in some meaningful order, but differences between data values can NOT be determined or are meaningless.
  + <span style="color:blue">Class (Freshman = 1, Sophomore = 2, Junior = 3, Senior = 4, Graduate = 5) </span> is **ordinal** because Sophomore is one class higher than Freshman.


<span style="color:red"> ***Interval and Ratio for Numerical Variables*** </span>

- **Interval**: The data have meaningful differences between any two values but the data do NOT have a **natural zero or starting point**. The data can do $\color{red} +$ and $\color{red} -$, but can't reasonably do $\color{red} \times$ and $\color{red} \div$. 
  + <span style="color:blue">Temperature</span> is **interval** because $80^{\circ}$F is 40 degrees higher than $40^{\circ}$F $(80-40=40)$, but $0^{\circ}$ does not mean NO heat and $80^{\circ}$F is NOT twice as hot as $40^{\circ}$F.
- **Ratio**: The data have both meaningful differences and ratios, and there is a natural zero starting point that indicates none of the quantity. The data can do $\color{red} +$, $\color{red} -$,  $\color{red} \times$ and $\color{red} \div$.
  + <span style="color:blue">Distance</span> is **ratio** because $80$ miles is twice as far as $40$ miles $(80/40 = 2)$, and $0$ mile means no distance.

## Exercises

1. **Data Type**: Identify each of the following as numerical or categorical data.
    (a) The names of the companies that manufacture paper towels
    (b) The colors of cars
    (c) The heights of football players
2. **Level of Measurements**: Identify the level of measurement used in each of the following.
    (a) The weights of people in a sample of people living in Milwaukee.
    (b) A physician's descriptions of "abstains from smoking, light smoker, moderate smoker, heavy smoker."
    (c) Flower classifications of "rose, tulip, daisy."
    (d) Suzy measures time in days, with 0 corresponding to her birth date. The day before her birth is -1, the day after her birth is +1, and so on. Suzy has converted the dates of major historical events to her numbering system. What is the level of measurement of these numbers?
3. **Discrete vs Continuous**: Determine whether the data are discrete or continuous.
    (a) The length of stay (in days) for each COVID patient in Wisconsin.
    (b) Several subjects are randomly selected and their heights are recorded.
    (c) From a data set, we see that a male had an arm circumference of 31.28 cm.
    (d) A sample of married couples is randomly selected and the number of animals in each family is recorded.
4. **Sampling Method**: Identify which of these types of sampling is used: random, stratified, or cluster.
    (a) Dr. Yu surveys his statistics class by identifying groups of males and females, then randomly selecting 7 students from each of those two groups.
    (b) Dr. Yu conducts a survey by randomly selecting 5 different sports teams at Marquette and surveying all of the student-athletes on those teams.
    (c) 427 subjects were randomly assigned to (1) meditation or (2) no mediation group to study the effectiveness of this mindfulness activity on lowering blood pressure.
5. **Study Type**: Determine whether the study is an experiment or an observational study, then identify a major problem with this study.
    (a) In a survey conducted by *USA Today*, 998 Internet users chose to respond to the question:"How often do you seek medical advice online?" 42% of the respondents said "frequently."
    (b) The Physicians' Health Study involved 21,045 female physicians. Based on random selections, 11,224 of them were treated with aspirin and other other 9,821 were given placebos. The study was stopped early because it became clear that aspirin did not reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions by a substantial amount.
