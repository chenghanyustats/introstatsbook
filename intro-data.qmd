## Statistics is a Science of Data, so What is Data?

- **Data**: A set of **objects** on which we observe or measure one or more **characteristics**.
- Objects are individuals, observations, subjects or cases in statistical studies.
- A characteristic or attribute is called a **variable** because it *varies* from one to another.
- For example, the data set right here is a set of Marquette basketball players.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/mu_data.png")
```
- The objects are individuals or players in the data.
- And each player has several characteristics or attributes shown in columns associated with him.
    + For example, his #, class, position, height, weight, hometown, and high school.
- These characteristics are called variables because they vary from one to another.

## Data 
- We usually store a data set in a matrix form that has rows and columns.
- Each row corresponds to a unique case or observational unit.
- Each column represents a characteristic or variable.
- This structure allows new cases to be added as rows or new variables as new columns.

```{r mu_data, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/mu_data.png")
```


## Target Population
- The first step in conducting a study is to *identify questions* to be investigated.
- A clear research question is helpful in identifying 
  + what *cases* should be studied (row)
  + what *variables* are important (column)
  
- Target **Population**: The **complete** collection of data we'd like to make inference about.

- *What is the average GPA of currently enrolled Marquette students?*
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/study.jpeg")
```

- The population is a set of **all** objects which we are interested in studying from. 
- Because all Marquette undergrads that are currently enrolled is the **complete** collection of data we'd like to make inference about, each currently enrolled Marquette undergrad is an object.
    + Note that students who are not currently enrolled or students that are already graduated are not our interest, and they shouldn't be a part of target population.
- Average GPA is the variable or population property we would like to make inference about.


## Sample Data

- Sometimes, it's possible to collect data of all cases we are interested in.
- Most of the time, it is too expensive to collect data for every case in a population.
- What about the average GPA of all students in Illinois? The U.S.? The world? `r emoji('scream')` `r emoji('scream')` `r emoji('scream')`

- Sampling is our solution to it. 
- A **sample** is a **subset** of cases selected from a population.
- The idea is that we are not able to compute the average GPA of a population, but we can collect a sample from that population which has way less objects than the population.
- Then we compute the average GPA of the sample data.
- We hope the sample average GPA can be close to the population average GPA because the population GPA is our main interest, not the sample GPA.
- To have sample average GPA close to population GPA, we want the sample to look like the population so that the sample and the population share similar attributes including GPA.

## Good Sample vs. Bad Sample

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## Is **this 4740/5740 class** a sample of the target population Marquette students?
:::

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## Is **this 4740/5740 class** a *"good"* sample of the target population?
:::


- Does **this 4740 class** look like the target population?

- The sample is convenient to be collected, but it is NOT **representative** of the population.
- You are mostly STEM majors, and so with a high chance, your average GPA is not the same as the GPA of humanities or business students.
- **Biased** sample: The average GPA of the class may be far from that of all MU undergrads.
- Sample data must be collected in an appropriate way. If not GIGO.

## How and Why a Representative Sample?
- We always seek to **randomly** select a sample from a population.
- Random sampling usually give us a representative Sample, as long as the sample size, or the number of objects in the sample, is not too small.
- Lots of statistical methods are based on *randomness assumption*.

```{r, ref.label="sample", echo=FALSE}

```

## Two Types of Studies to Collect Sample Data

- **Observational Study**: Observe and measure characteristics/variables, and do **NOT** attempt to modify or intervene with the subjects being studied.

  + <span style="color:blue"> Sample from `r emoji('one')` the heart disease and `r emoji('two')` heart disease-free populations. Then record the fat content of the diets for the two groups.</span> </span> 

- **Experimental Study**: Apply some **treatment(s)** and then proceed to observe its responses or effects on the individuals (experimental units).

  + <span style="color:blue">Assign volunteers to one of several diets with different levels of dietary fat (treatments). Then compare the treatments with respect to the incidence of heart disease after a period of time. </span> 


:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## Observational or Experimental? 
- <span style="color:blue">Randomly select 40 males and 40 females to see the difference in blood pressure levels between male and female. </span> 
- <span style="color:blue"> Test the effects of a new drug by randomly dividing patients into 3 groups (high dosage, low dosage, placebo). </span> 
:::


## Limitation of Observational Studies: Confounding


- **Confounder**: A variable NOT included in a study but that affects the variables in the study.
- Observe past data that shows that increases in ice cream sales are associated with increases in drownings, and we conclude that **eating ice cream causes drownings**. 
`r emoji('scream')` `r emoji('confused')` `r emoji('interrobang')`

```
:::

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
### What is the confounder that is not in the data but affects ice cream sales and the number of drownings?
:::


-   ***Temperature***: As temperature increases, ice cream sales increase and the number of drownings goes up because more people swim.

knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/beach.jpeg")
```



## Causal Relationship
- Making causal conclusions based on *experiments* is often more reasonable than making the same causal conclusions based on observational data.
- Observational studies are generally only sufficient to show **associations, not causality**.


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(0,0,0,0))
plot(c(-0.05, 1.2), c(0.39, 1),
     type = 'n', xlab = "", ylab = "", axes = FALSE)
text(0.59, 0.89, 'temparature', font = 2)
rect(0.4, 0.8, 0.78, 1)

     cex = 1.5, col = COL[4])
```



## Simple Random Sample

- **Random Sample**: Each member of a population is **equally likely** to be selected.
- **Simple Random Sample (SRS)**: Every possible sample of sample size $n$ has the same chance to be chosen.
- **Example**: If I sample 100 students from all, say 10,000 Marquette students, I would *randomly* assign each student a number (from 1 to 10,000) and then *randomly* select 100 numbers.

## Categorical vs. Numerical Variables

- A **categorical** variable provides *non-numerical* information which can be placed in **one (and only one)** category from two or more categories.



  + <span style="color:blue">Gender (Male  `r emoji('man')`, Female  `r emoji('woman')`,  Trans  `r emoji('rainbow_flag')`) </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue">Class (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Graduate) </span>
  + <span style="color:blue">Country (USA `r emoji('us')`, Canada `r emoji('canada')`, UK `r emoji('uk')`, Germany `r emoji('de')`, Japan `r emoji('jp')`, Korea `r emoji('kr')`) </span> 


- A **numerical** variable is recorded in a *numerical* value representing counts or measurements.

  + <span style="color:blue"> GPA </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue"> The number of relationships you've had </span>
  + <span style="color:blue"> Height </span> 
  



## Numerical Variables can be Discrete or Continuous

- A **discrete** variable takes on values of a **finite** or **countable** number.

- A **continuous** variable takes on values **anywhere** over a particular range *without gaps or jumps*.
  + <span style="color:blue"> GPA is **continuous** because it can be any value between 0 and 4. </span> 
  + <span style="color:blue"> The number of relationships you've had is **discrete** because you can count the number and it is finite.</span>
  + <span style="color:blue"> Height is **continuous** because it can be any number within a range. </span> 


## Categorical Variables are Usually Recorded as Numbers 

- <span style="color:blue">Gender (Male = 0, Female = 1, Trans = 2) </span>
- <span style="color:blue">Class (Freshman = 1, Sophomore = 2, Junior = 3, Senior = 4, Graduate = 5) </span> 
- <span style="color:blue">Country (USA = 100, Canada = 101, UK = 200, Germany = 201, Japan = 300, Korea = 301) </span> 
- <span style="color:blue">United Airlines boarding groups</span> 

- **The numbers represent categories only; differences between them are meaningless.**
    * Canada - USA = 101 - 100 = 1?
    * Graduate - Sophomore = 5 - 2 = 3 = Junior?
- We need to learn the **level of measurements** to know whether or which arithmetic operations are meaningful.



## Levels of Measurements: Nominal and Ordinal for Categorical Variables

- **Nominal**: The data can *NOT be ordered* in a meaningful or natural way.
  + <span style="color:blue">Gender (Male = 0, Female = 1, Trans = 2) </span> is **nominal** because Male, Female and Trans cannot be ordered.
  + <span style="color:blue">Country (USA = 100, Canada = 101, UK = 200, Germany = 201, Japan = 300, Korea = 301) </span> is **nominal**.

- **Ordinal**: The data can be arranged in some meaningful order, but differences between data values can NOT be determined or are meaningless.
  + <span style="color:blue">Class (Freshman = 1, Sophomore = 2, Junior = 3, Senior = 4, Graduate = 5) </span> is **ordinal** because Sophomore is one class higher than Freshman.


## Levels of Measurements: Interval and Ratio for Numerical Variables

- **Interval**: The data have meaningful differences between any two values but the data do NOT have a **natural zero or starting point**. The data can do $\color{red} +$ and $\color{red} -$, but can't reasonably do $\color{red} \times$ and $\color{red} \div$. 
  + <span style="color:blue">Temperature</span> is **interval** because $80^{\circ}$F is 40 degrees higher than $40^{\circ}$F $(80-40=40)$, but $0^{\circ}$ does not mean NO heat and $80^{\circ}$F is NOT twice as hot as $40^{\circ}$F.
- **Ratio**: The data have both meaningful differences and ratios, and there is a natural zero starting point that indicates none of the quantity. The data can do $\color{red} +$, $\color{red} -$,  $\color{red} \times$ and $\color{red} \div$.
  + <span style="color:blue">Distance</span> is **ratio** because $80$ miles is twice as far as $40$ miles $(80/40 = 2)$, and $0$ mile means no distance.

## Converting Numerical to Categorical

- You've already seen an example.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
letter <- c("A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-",
                       "D+", "D", "F")
percentage <- c("[94, 100]", "[90, 94)", "[87, 90)", "[83, 87)", "[80, 83)",
                "[77, 80)", "[73, 77)", "[70, 73)", 
                "[65, 70)", "[60, 65)", "[0, 60)")
grade_dist <- data.frame(Grade = letter, Percentage = percentage)
knitr::kable(grade_dist, longtable = TRUE, format = "html", align = 'l') %>% kable_styling(position = "center", font_size = 25)
