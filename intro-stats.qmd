## Statistics as Numeric Records

In ordinary conversations, the word **statistics** is used as a term to indicate a set or collection of **numeric records** as shown in @fig-stats.

- Interestingly someone defines statistics as the only field where two experts, using identical data, may come to completely opposite conclusions @fig-stat-shirt, which is true in some sense. We'll see why later in this course. With the same data, different statistical methods may produce different results and lead to difference conclusions.

## Statistics as a Discipline

-   Forget about that useless definition.

```

-   From Wiki, Statistics is formally defined as the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.

-   **Statistics** is a **Science of Data**.
-   A ***science of data*** using **statistical thinking, methods and models**.
-   There might be another science of data. I'm not saying statistics is THE science of data.

## Difference between Statistics and Data Science

-   [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/data-science.asp) defines Data Science as a field of applied mathematics and statistics that provides useful information based on large amounts of complex data or **big data**.

-   But Dan Ariely, a famous behavioral economist at Duke once asked: So what on earth is DS? 
-   Maybe nobody has the exactly correct answer.

## UC Santa Cruz Department of Statistics Courses

knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/ucsc_courses.png")
```

-   This shows statistics courses offered by UC Santa Cruz, the university I graduated from.
-   You can see that statistics focuses much more on data analysis, methods and models.
-   The stats department doesn't talk a lot about data collection, organization, data presentation or data visualization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Science Is Now a Broader View of Statistics

-   Collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%",fig.align='center'}
#| fig-cap: >
#|   Figure 1.7: The Data Science process. Created at Harvard by Joe Blitzstein and Hanspeter Pfister.
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/ds_process.jpeg")
```

-   Data science is more like a broader view of statistics.
-   Because again, in typical statistics departments, we don't really teach or do much research on data collection, cleaning, storage, database management, and data visualization, which all are now a part of DS.
-   Statistics focuses very much on data analysis and modeling.
-   Anyway, please don't worry about the names.
-   The important thing is you learn useful methods to help you analyze your data no matter what it is called, statistics or data science.

## What Do We Learn In this Course

<!-- - We will discuss most of materials in Chapter 1 to 9. -->

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/book_content.png")
```

-   In particular, we will spend most of the time talking about probability and statistical inference methods.

## We Focus On Statistical Inference

-   We spend most of time on various *statistical methods for analyzing data*.
-   Learn useful information
    -   about the **population** we are interested
    -   from our **sample data**
    -   through **statistical inferential** methods, including **estimation** and **testing**
-   Don't worry if you have no idea what these terms are.
-   These are what we will discuss throughout the course, and I'll explain each term in detail later in class.
