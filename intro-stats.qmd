## What is Statistics?

- Statistics can be defined in a variety of ways, and there doesn't seem to be one definition that describes it best.
- For our purposes, statistics can be generally divided into two overarching categories.
  - Statistics as a set of numeric records
  - Statistics as a discipline

<span style="color:blue"> **Statistics as a Set of Numeric Records** </span>

- In ordinary conversations, the word **statistics** is used as a term to indicate a set or collection of **numeric records**.
- For example, @fig-mj-stats below shows Michael Jordan's career statistics from his time in the NBA.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of statistics as a set of numeric records (Source: https://www.nba.com/stats/player/893/career)"}
#| label: fig-mj-stats
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/mj_stats.png")
```

- However, this is just one way of defining statistics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="color:blue"> **Statistics as a Discipline** </span>

- As previously stated, other definitions of statistics exist including the one shown in @fig-stats-shirt.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%",fig.align='center', fig.cap="Statistics Shirt (Source: shorturl.at/vEMNS)"}
#| label: fig-stats-shirt
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/statistics.jpg")
```
- This definition emphasizes the idea that with the same data, different statistical methods may produce different results and lead to different conclusions.


- Wiki lists a more formal definition of statistics in @fig-wiki-quote below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%",fig.align='center', fig.cap="More formal definition of statistics (Source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics)"}
#| label: fig-wiki-quote
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/stats_wiki.png")
```

- **Statistics** can also be described as a **Science of Data** that uses **statistical thinking, methods and models**.

## Difference between Statistics and Data Science

<!-- ![The RStudio environment pane keeps track of the R objects you create.](images/hopr_0102.png){#fig-environment} -->

<span style="color:blue"> **Data Science** </span>

- Because of their shared attributes, many find it hard to differentiate between statistics and data science.
- The tweets below poke fun at the lack of clarity surrounding the definition of data science/data scientists (@fig-twit-borat).

- A more formal definition of data science can be found on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/data-science.asp).
- This site defines Data Science as a field of applied mathematics and statistics that provides useful information based on large amounts of complex data or **big data**.
- Although this definition is helpful for understanding data science, Dan Ariely, a famous behavioral economist at Duke, joked about their use of the term big data in his tweet below (@fig-bigdata).

- More information can be gathered about the differences between these two fields from looking at the courses offered in the Statistics Department at UC Santa Cruz.
- From @fig-courses below, one can see that statistics primarily focuses on data analysis, methods and models. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%",fig.align='center', fig.cap= "Courses offered by the Department of Statistics at UC Santa Cruz (Source: https://courses.soe.ucsc.edu/)"}
#| label: fig-courses
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/ucsc_courses.png")
```

- This statistics department, in particular, doesn't talk a lot about data collection, organization, data presentation or data visualization.
- Although statistics does not focus on these concepts, they are encompassed within the field of data science.
- The data science process includes the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data (@fig-process).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%",fig.align='center', fig.cap= "The data science process created at Harvard by Joe Blitzstein and Hanspeter Pfister"}
#| label: fig-process
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/ds_process.jpeg")
```

- In typical statistics departments, there isn't much instruction or research done on data collection, cleaning, storage, database management, and data visualization.
- Because statistics continues to focus on data analysis and modeling, Data Science now addresses these other processes that statistics passes over.

## What Will We Learn In this Course?

- Below, the main topics of this course, as well as brief descriptions, are listed in the order in which they will be covered.
.
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/book_content.png")
```

- We will spend most of our time talking about probability and the statistical inference methods that are circled on the list above.
- This course will also include a focus on the *statistical methods for analyzing data*.
- In summary, we will learn useful information
  - about the **population** we are interested in
  - from our **sample data**
  - through **statistical inferential** methods, including **estimation** and **testing**
