# Sience of Data and Data Science {#sec-intro-stats}



```{r}
#| echo: false
source("./_common.R")
```

In ordinary conversations, the word **statistics** is used as a term to indicate a set or collection of **numeric records**. as shown in @fig-stats

Interestingly someone defines statistics as the only field where two experts, using identical data, may come to completely opposite conclusions @fig-stat-shirt, which is true in some sense. And we'll see why later in this course. With the same data, different statistical methods may produce different results and lead to difference conclusions.

## Statistics as a Discipline

- Forget about that useless definition.
- From Wiki, Statistics is formally defined as the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.


- **Statistics** is a **Science of Data**.

- So, **Statistics** is a **Science of Data**.
- There might be another science of data. I'm not saying statistics is THE science of data.


- A __*science of data*__ using **statistical thinking, methods and models**.



- To me, statistics is a science of data using statistical thinking and methods.


`r emo::ji('thinking')` But wait, then what is **DATA SCIENCE** `r emo::ji('question')`


- But wait, if statistics is a science of data, then what is  **DATA SCIENCE**?


## Difference between Statistics and Data Science

- [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/data-science.asp) defines Data Science is a field of applied mathematics and statistics that provides useful information based on large amounts of complex data or **big data**.

- But Dan Ariely, a famous behavioral economist at Duke once said:
- So What on earth is DS? Maybe nobody has the exactly correct answer.


## UC Santa Cruz Department of Statistics Courses

```

- Here shows statistics courses offered by UC Santa Cruz the university I graduated from.
- You can see that statistics focus much more on data analysis, methods and models.
- The stats department don't talk much about on data collection, organization, and data presentation or data visualization.

---
## Data Science Is Now a Broader View of Statistics
- Collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%",fig.align='center'}
#| fig-cap: >
#|   The Data Science process. Created at Harvard by Joe Blitzstein and Hanspeter Pfister.
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/ds_process.jpeg")
```


- And now data science is more like a broader view of statistics.
- Because again, in usual statistics department, we don't really teach or do much research on data collection, cleaning, storage, database management, and data visualization, which all are now a part of DS.
- Statistics focus very much on data analysis and modeling.
- Anyway, please don't care about the names.
- The important thing is, you learn useful methods to help you analyze your data.
- No matter what it is called statistics or data science.


## What Do We Learn In this Course

<!-- - We will discuss most of materials in Chapter 1 to 9. -->

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/book_content.png")
```


- In particular, we will spend most of the time talking about probability and statistical inference methods OK.

## We Focus On Statistical Inference

- We spend most of time on various *statistical methods for analyzing data*.
- Learn useful information
  + about the **population** we are interested
  + from our **sample data**
  + through **statistical inferential** methods, including **estimation** and **testing**


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/img-intro/population_sample.png")
```


- In fact, we like to learn some information or something useful
  + about the **population** we are interested
  + from our **sample** data
  + through **statistical inferential** methods, including **estimation** and **testing**
- Don't worry if you have no idea of these terms.
- These are what we will discuss throughout the course, and I'll explain each term in detail later in class. OK.
